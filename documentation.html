     <h1>Documentation</h1> 
     <p>In this page, the documentation for the website can be found. In the <a href="#firstpar">first paragraph</a>, the exhibition’s topic is discussed; in the <a href="#secondpar">second paragraph </a>, the items are introduced and briefly described. In <a href="#thirdpar">paragraph three</a>, the chosen narratives are described; <a href="#fourthpar">paragraph four </a> reports on the layout and CSS choices. <a href="#fifthpar">Paragraph five</a> briefly describes the structure of the website. </p>
     <div>
      <h3 id="#firstpar">1.The exhibition</h3>
      <p>The first step in designing the exhibition was choosing the appropriate topic, according to criteria of relevance, saliency and chronological and geographical boundaries. In particular, the ideal topic should’ve span across centuries connecting ancient and recent eras: this choice was motivated both by content requirements, as it’d provide a wider range of possible museum items, and by design choices, as it’d enable to find layout inspirations and solutions in multiple, different eras.
         <br>The evolution of writing materials was deemed the appropriate choice in terms of historical relevance, temporal and geographical extension and proximity to our studies’ background. Additionally, it enabled us to explore different perspectives, which were useful in determining the three required narratives. Overall, the topic was chosen for its relevance in human life, culture and evolution: writing is an unavoidable part of daily life, and has evolved greatly across centuries, causing, following and participating in almost every major event in human history. </p>
     </div>
     
     <div>
      <h3 id="secondpar">2. The items</h3>
      <p>The evolution of writing and writing supports is unavoidably connected to human history and evolution, hence spanning across centuries and millennia. As the exhibit aimed at being comprehensive, cohesive and encompassing, it was necessary to choose carefully the items to be exhibited, with regards to their representativeness, exemplarity and specificity.  The limited number of available items made it necessary to identify two chronological macro-areas, Antiquity and Modernity, each represented by ten items; the macro-areas were then populated with the items considered more appropriate and illustrative. <br>The Antiquity macro-area covers a considerable span of centuries and inventions, from the creation of the cuneiform (IV millennium BCE) to the 18th century circa. Three micro-areas were selected to provide both a wide-ranging description of writing habits in Antiquity and some general guidelines for further explorations and analyses: the materials used as writing surfaces; the writing instruments; the production of written documents. A fourth micro area was considered: materials and tools for personal and public communication. Following this subdivision, the items were then chosen according to three main criteria: their representativeness, their specific quality, and their potential for a meaningful contrast with items belonging to the modern era. The extension of the considered period made it inevitable to overlook some materials, despite their undeniable historical importance and relevance to the topic.  </p>
      <div>
      <h4>Amarna tablet</h4>
      <p>Clay tablets are not the first support to be used for communication and memory-keeping, but their widespread use and their strong connection with the first writing systems make them a fundamental step in the history of writing supports. This particular exemplar and the series it belongs to are specifically important as they attest to the a) widespread geographical and chronological use; b) variety of uses and topics; c) cultural and historical importance, both for their contemporaries and for modern-day scholars. </p>
       
      <h4>Papyrus</h4>
      <p>A staple in the modern popular imaginary of writing means, before paper papyrus was probably the most used material in the Mediterranean and Near East. The choice of this specific exemplar, as well, was determined by its geographical and chronological contexts, but it was also guided by the possibility of adding a different dimension regarding the contents and uses of ancient materials. </p>
      
      <h4>Vindolanda tablet</h4>
      <p>The choice of wooden tablets, on the other hand, was motivated mostly to stimulate curiosity by adding a potentially lesser-known material and by providing the opportunity to briefly explore communication ways and means in antiquity. This particular exemplar can also help expand the geographical horizon of the exhibition and expand the discussion on women writing in history. </p>
   
      <h4>Inkwell</h4>
      <p>Writing instruments have changed greatly over the centuries, and one of the most significant changes has been in the evolution of storage and use of inks. This item helps introducing the topic and provides an interesting element of comparison with East Asian tools for the production of ink. </p>   
       
      <h4>Night-shining white</h4>
      <p>An historical description of writing materials cannot of course set aside paper and its production. In particular, the choice fell on an item that could be strictly connected to East Asia and illustrate the various uses and applications of paper.</p>

      <h4>Inkstone in the form of a quin</h4>
      <p>Alongside the Roman inkwell, this exemplar constitutes one part of the contrastive pair exemplifying how the same practical need could be solved and realized in different ways. Additionally, the exemplar allows for the inclusion in the exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and instruments.</p>

      <h4>Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy</h4>
      <p>As an element of novelty and variation on the topic, xylography was chosen as a technique relevant for the exhibition for its artistic value, practical, widespread use and interesting element of comparison with later printing systems. This particular exemplar was chosen for a) its intrinsic beaty; b) original geographical location, as it allowed for a comprehensive and extensive description of the technique; c) its combination of visual art and writing, to stimulate reflection on the connection of art and literature.</p>
      
      <h4>Quill pen</h4>
      <p>With papyrus, quill pens are probably the most renowned and romanticized instruments in the modern imaginary of historical writing. This item provides also an opportunity to explore the medieval scriptoria as fundamental scenarios for literature evolution and preservation in the Western world. </p>

      <h4>Gutenberg Bible</h4>
      <p>The invention of the moving type printing system has irrevocably changed the diffusion of books, and, consequently, of the materials needed for their production. The increased production prompted changes in the quality and manufacturing of paper, leading to the creation of modern paper and paper books. </p>

      <h4>Early fountain pen</h4>
      <p>The fountain pen ideally concludes the Antiquity macro-area, solidifying this first part as the evolution from early materials and tools to the modern pen-and-paper traditional idea of writing. This particular exemplar is also relevant for its use in a culturally and socially important event. </p>
   
   </div>

      <p>The Modernity macro-area, although spanning just three centuries (18th-19th-20th), navigates through plenty fundamental innovations in writing styles and tools: as we can see, the evolution of writing instruments speeds up incredibly in this centuries, and quickly leads to a revolution in writing, reading and communication habits. </p>
      <div>
         <h4>Sholes and Glidden type-writer</h4>
         <p>It is the first commercially successful typewriter, representing a turning point in the history of writing technologies. It introduced the QWERTY keyboard, a layout still used today. The typewriter became common office equipment, and the entrance of women into white-collar sectors, as many of them were hired to operate the new typewriter.
</p>

         <h4>Blickensderfer No.5 typewriter</h4>
         <p>Among the first truly portable, full-keyboard typewriters, Blickensderfer typewriters’ lightweight aluminum body, compact form, and interchangeable typewheel attracted huge orders. It also featured a patented type action using their patented “type wheel,” a metal wheel holding all characters rotated to strike the paper, producing inked marks.</p>

         <h4>Underwood Model 5</h4>
         <p>Underwood Model 5 featured front-strike visible typing, which allowed the typist to see the text as they typed without lifting the carriage to check the result, improving speed and productivity. It was an essential shift in how writers interacted with machines. In this way, the Underwood Model 5 was the first truly modern typewriter. It is famously used by American writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Stephen King.
</p>

         <h4>Olivetti lettera 22</h4>
         <p>Designed by Marcello Nizzoli in 1949, this portable mechanical typewriter is one of the most popular and iconic typewriters. It was chosen as the best-designed product of the last 100 years by the Illinois Institute of Technology. Many notable figures have used it, such as Tom Hanks and Leonard Cohen.
</p>

         <h4>IBM Selectric Typewriter</h4>
         <p>It is a highly successful line of typewriters produced by IBM in 1961, as the three models of Selectric hold 75 percent of the business electric typewriter market in the United States. Unlike the traditional typewriters used in that period, Selectric innovatively adopted the chrome-plated plastic “element”, which could be easily interchanged to use different fonts within the same document on the same typewriter. </p>

         <h4>IBM 6580 Displaywriter</h4>
         <p>The IBM 6580 Displaywriter represents an unsuccessful path in the evolution of digital writing tools. Born in 1980, precisely between the end of the typewriter era and the beginning of the personal computer era, it served as a transitional device. Moreover, it was only one year older than the IBM PC 5150; comparing the two machines illustrates why dedicated tools ultimately lost out to general-purpose platforms.</p>

         <h4>IBM 5150 </h4>
         <p>The IBM Personal Computer(model 5150) is the first microcomputer released in the IBM PC model line, which had a great influence on the personal computer market. Users can use a text editor based on DOS system, including WordStar, EasyWriter and WordPerfect, which allows typing and command operating by keyboards.</p>

         <h4>Apple Lisa</h4>
         <p>It is the first mass-market personal computer operable through a graphical user interface(GUI). Although considered a commercial failure because of its high price and lack of software application, Apple Lisa was appreciated for its advanced feature ,which had reappeared on the Macintosh.</p>

         <h4>Apple Cadillac PDA</h4>
         <p>This innovation marked the moment when desktop writing transformed into “portable” writing. Writing has no longer been limited in environments like home and offices. It integrated handwriting, digital schedule management in one equipment, and paved for the development of Newton, Palm and mobile writing application on smart phone.
</p>

         <h4>U.S. Robotics Palm Pilot 5000</h4>
         <p>The U.S. Robotics Palm Pilot 5000 is a digital handheld device that ordinary people are willing to use for daily note-taking and writing. For the first time, the Palm Pilot made digitizing handwriting reliable, simple, and affordable enough to truly integrate into the daily writing habits of ordinary people. It is the starting point for the transformation from "sitting down to write" to "writing anytime, anywhere," a transformation that ultimately leads to our current habit of recording everything with our mobile phones.</p>
      </div>
   
      <p>We chose Dublin Core(DC) as the basic metadata standard for the items, because its core elements can describe most of our items. The time span of our items starts from 14th century BCE to 1990, covering handwriting tools, typewriters and digital instruments. Secondly, our exhibition items come from different museums: the Dublin Core standard, as an international standard, can be supported by most cultural organisation. Thirdly, Dublin Core is expandable. So custom fields can be added to the core fields. 
Most of our items belong to crm:E22HumanMadeObject, and the core elements of Dublin Core can be used to describe the properties of these items. All the items shared the core fields of this standard. Then, for some properties of the items, we used extensive fields from DCTerms to describe them, including dcterms:created, dcterms:medium and so on. In addition, for some properties, we used schema and crm to describe them, which are more accurate to describe items in the museums or the cultural heritage objects.</p>
       <p>We used dc:creator to describe the inventor of the writing instruments.
We used dcterms:created to describe the date when the items were created or invented.
We used dcterms:medium to describe the material of the items.
We used schema:locationcreated to describe the place where the items were invented or found.
We used dc:format to describe the dimensions of the items.
We used crm:P2hastype to describe the type of the items.
We used dc:title to describe the title of the items.
We used crm:P55hascurrentlocation to describe the current holding institution of the items.

      <h3 id="thirdpar">3. The Narratives</h3>
      <p>To describe the history of writing materials, we tailored the narratives on three perspectives: the chronological evolution of materials and resources; the people involved in their creation, and the problems they tried to solve; the main uses and applications. </p>
      <div>
         <h4>3.1. Through Time</h4>
         <p>The first narrative retells the evolution of writing supports according to its linear chronological timeline: from Antiquity to Modernity, the evolution is told through all the twenty items, representative of the major steps and innovations in this flux. <br>
This narrative is designed to be comprehensive and general: the visitors are assumed to have a conventional, broad knowledge of the topics, and to wish to learn more about it: on the introductory and intermediate levels the information provided cover the basic, needed knowledge, while on the advanced level more technical insights, when possible, are included. As it comprises all available items, it’s the longest possible narrative. 
</p>
      </div>   
      <div>
         <h4>3.2. Among People</h4>
         <p>The second narrative is thought to narrate the evolution of materials through the lens of the people involved in their creation, improvements and major applications. When possible, information the individual directly responsible for the items’ inventions are provided; for Antiquity’s items, as often it is not possible to determine a single creator, broader groups of people and inventors are considered. <br>
The narrative is proposed as a medium-length tour that takes the visitors through the major personalities in the history of writing medium: in particular, when possible, the main challenges and problems that the individuals have faced or tried to solve are highlighted, to further underline the practical, tangible effects of writing and writing materials’ choices in daily life. The visitors are assumed to be already comfortable, to varying degrees, to the exhibit topics, and to wish to learn more from a different perspective. 
</p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h4>3.3. Across Uses</h4>
         <p>The third and final narrative focuses on the major, core uses of writing materials in history. It’s the narrative less bound to chronological boundaries, and, in the way it was designed, probably the less complex thematically. It consists of only a few items, and hence is the shortest. The visitors are assumed to a have a general background on the topic, and to wish for a lean, light and not taxing visit that can, at the same time, enrich their knowledge. </p>
      </div>
   
   </div>
      
     <div>
      <h3 id="fourthpar">4. The Themes</h3>
      <p>The themes were chosen to visually represent and evoke salient steps in the evolution of the writing supports. Two themes were assigned to Antiquity and Modernity each. </p>
      
      <div>
        <h4>4.1. Clay tablets</h4> 
         <p>The first theme was inspired by clay tablets, as one of the first supports used for writing and the oldest in the exhibition. <br>
To define the layout and CSS characteristics, a first, general investigation on different types of clay tablets was conducted to identify their main characteristics. Three key aspects were established: the general rectangular shape and vertical orientation of the tablets; the “sharpness” of the signs inscribed on them, typical of the cuneiform system; the distinctive colors that clay can assume. Once these abstract parameters were identified, the general characteristics of layout could be sketched. </p>
<p>The mineralogical components of clay assign to it a range of different shades, from light beiges to reds and browns, depending on the concentration of iron oxides. Reds and yellows were chosen as the starting points to build the palette, with browns and blues to provide contrast and to lessen the intensity of the warm colors. The specific hues were then chosen according to their compatibility, potential use in functional areas, and contrast. For the latter, the general indications of the W3C recommend a contrast of 3:1 against background for large texts (18pt and up, or 14pt bold and up) and a contrast of 4.5:1 against background for smaller texts: the colors in the palette were texted to respect these indications. </p>
<p>For the surface color, neutral colors are usually advised to avoid fatigue: as reds are typically considered more intense and overwhelming, a less rich but still vivid yellow was chosen. For the on-surface color, the choice fell on a deep blue hue with an adequate high contrast for both small and large texts. </p>
<p>As the primary color for structural elements like the navbar and the buttons, a darker red hue was chosen to ensure higher readability compared to the surface color and to the texts. The related on-primary color was picked following the same criteria. Container colors (defined as fill colors for background elements) were found among the browns; to guarantee continuity, the on-surface color was chosen for the text on the containers. The resulting contrast is not perfectly adequate for small texts, but it ensures proper readability for larger texts.  </p>
<p>We wanted to replicate as much as possible the sharp and antique quality found in clay tablets, while still maintaining legibility. As a sans-serif, antique-felling font, Julius Sans One was picked for titles and, in general, for short, important texts; for longer texts, it was chosen a clear, more modern complementary font that could enhance legibility and prevent weariness. </p>
<p>Clay tablets were usually molded as rectangles and oriented vertically and generally lacked decorative elements. The general layout was then thought of as simple and functional, with the elements stacked on top of each other and centered on the page. To avoid the feeling of excessive empty space on the borders of the viewport, some lateral decorative images were inserted to further delimit the content area. The lateral insertions also added a positive contrast with the background color. 
</p>
      </div>

       <div>
        <h4>4.2. Woodcut</h4> 
         <p>The second theme was meant to be a bridge within antiquity and modernity: as it ought to cover a quite wide chronological arc, the primary inspiration had to be wide-ranging, significant, and meaningful under multiple perspectives. For its historical value and relevance to the exhibition, xylography was chosen as the thematic core; for its artistic quality, materials and production technique, the Ten Bamboo Studio Collection of calligraphy and painting (17th century) was considered the main inspiration. </p>
         <p>The basic, core characteristics of the artistic work were identified in the paper surface and colorful inks. For the surface color, a light, soft grey was chosen both for its neutrality and similarity with the color of old paper. On the surface, floral decorations are added to evoke the prints and drawings in the inspiring piece: while the overall airy and ethereal quality was difficult to replicate, the colors were determined on the basis of the yellows, pinks, blues and greens present in the artwork. As the on-surface color and, in general, as the color for longer texts, a deep grey was chosen, as it ensured a high contrast on the light grey of the surface and reminded of the black ink used for text and outlines in the artwork. </p>
         <p>For the container resembling a book page, to replicate the transitions of colors in old, weathered paper, three light greys and whites were chosen to create a soft, realistic transition. </p>
         <p>As the primary color, a rich green was chosen, with the lightest color from the paper transitional trio as the on-primary. As the secondary color, the vintage pink was chosen, with the ink-inspired grey as the color for the text. All choices tried to ensure the highest contrast and readability, while still respecting the original inspiration. </p>
         <p>To evoke the artistic flow of traditional calligraphy, a paintbrush-inspired font was chosen for the main titles and buttons’ texts. For the descriptive texts, to avoid overwhelming the readers with a too complex font, a lighter, leaner font was preferred, inspired by the modern printed texts. </p>
         <p>The main goal was to replicate a page-like disposition of the content on the webpage, ideally resembling the left and right pages in an open book. A container was created and styled so that it could resemble a old book page; in complex, content-rich pages, the contained elements were organized in two columns, ideally displaying the left-right disposition of an open book; in less complex pages, the elements were simply stacked one on top of the other. To give the idea of a traditionally handprinted text, the descriptive texts were justified and stored in rectangular containers, significantly less wide than the fake-page. 
</p>
      </div>

       <div>
        <h4>4.3 Typewriter</h4> 
         <p>The typewriter theme is based on the concept of vintage typewriters and grid paper. Therefore, I chose the classic color of the Olivetti Lettera 22, one of the most iconic typewriters writing tools in history, for the background color of the webpages. The grid paper effect was also used to imitate grid paper.</p>
          <p>Regarding the font, I chose the Courier New, which comes from the Courier font family, one of the most popular typefaces for offices. Initially designed for IBM typewriters, Courier was later revised for the IBM’s Selectric typewriter series. Courier New is a monospaced typeface in which every letter is the same width and lines up vertically.</p>
           <p>The wide letters are easy to read and do not crowd the page, making them the default choice for authors and screenwriters when sending manuscripts to publishers, or writing letters. I chose Courier New because it most closely resembles typewritten text, which matches the typewriter theme.</p>
         <p>I used a beige-filled text box as the background for the text to mimic the style of a sticky note, which fits the office background where a typewriter is used.</p>
      </div>

       <div>
        <h4>4.4 Digital era</h4> 
         <p>The digital theme was created based on the concept of The Matrix, one of the most well-known sci-fi films. A poster of the main character, the hacker “Neo,” standing before a green code rain background is an iconic image in film history.</p>
         <p>The green tint is also used throughout the film for various scenes, costumes and props, creating a cold atmosphere. Most importantly, it differentiates the Matrix world (green tint) from the real world (blue and red tints).</p>
         <p>Regarding the font, I chose Roboto Mono, a monospaced font from the Google Fonts family. It is optimized for coding due to its highly legible features. In other fonts, for example, the digit ‘1’ and the letter “I’, the zero ‘0’ and letter ‘O’ can look similar. However, in Roboto Mono, the distinct character shapes of them are easily distinguishable.</p>
         <p>In this way, I chose Matrix green as the color and Roboto Mono as the font of the words for the digital theme. Both of them represent a sense of the digital world: cool, crisp and efficient, just like the way content is produced in the digital era.</p>
