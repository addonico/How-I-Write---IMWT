            <p class="short"> Clay is one of the earliest materials used as a writing support. Cheap, easy to find and to mold, it was used to create tablets to store information of any kind. This tablet, in particular, is a letter from the king of Mitanni, king Tushratta, to queen Tiy (or Teye), queen of Egypt and Great Royal Wife of pharaoh Amenhotep III.  </p>
            <p class="medium">Before paper was introduced, many different materials were used as writing support: clay was one of the most common, and among the earliest to be used. Clay would be molded in a rectangular shape – a tablet- and, while still wet, its surface would be inscribed with a pointy tool. 
              <br>This particular tablet, tablet E29794, belongs to the Amarna Letters’ series. Dated to the 14th century BCE, it contains a letter from the king of Mitanni (modern day Syria and Turkey), king Tushratta, to the queen of Egypt and Great Royal Wife of pharaoh Amenhotep III, Tiy (or Teye). The text is written in cuneiform, one of the oldest writing systems, so called as each character is shaped as a wedge.
             </p>
            <p class="long">Keeping tracks of one’s activities has always been an important issue. Even before the first writing systems were created, people would look for ways to keep records: usually, some symbols representing a concept or a real-life object would be carved into a natural support, like stones or shells. In Mesopotamia, for example, shapes and lines were pressed into clay tablets to count objects for accounting purposes; by the 4th millennium BCE (circa 3200 BCE!) this early system is believed to evolve in the first writing system, the cuneiform, so called as each stroke is shaped as a wedge, meaning it has a thick end and a narrower one. 
                <br>Clay was one of the most used supports, as it was easy to obtain, to work and to shape: while its surface was wet, the desired symbols would be carved onto it, usually using a tool with a pointy end. The tablet would be then dried, either by the sun or in specific ovens, and then stored. Clay tablets were then relatively easy and cheap to make: as so, they were used for many different purposes, from business accounting to contracts, from private letters to literary pieces.  
                 <br>This clay tablet, tablet E29794, contains a letter, but of a particular kind: it’s a diplomatic letter written by king Tushratta, king of Mitanni (in modern day Syria and Turkey), to queen Tiy, queen of Egypt and mother of Akhenaten, in which the king recalls the friendship ties between the kingdoms and hopes for stronger bonds. This letter is truly important: not only it tells us about the relationship between two of the most important kingdoms of the time, but it is also one of the first times when a queen is directly addressed in a written communication.

             <p class="intermediate short">Clay tablets have always been extremely common, even more so after cuneiform, one of the first writing systems, was created, in Mesopotamia in the IV millennium BCE. This type of tablet was used for almost every purpose of everyday life: from business transactions and record keeping to diplomatic letters and literary and religious texts. Tablet E29794 is an example of clay tablets used as medium for diplomatic correspondence: king Tushratta of Mitanni addresses queen Tiy, queen of Egypt and mother of Akhenaten. </p>
            <p class="intermediate medium">Clay is one of the earliest and most commonly used writing materials. Cheap and easily accessible, it was molded in the desired shape- usually, as a rectangle- and its surface, while wet, would be inscribed with a stylus, usually in bone or metal. The inscribed tablet would then be either left to dry in the sun or baked in specific ovens, becoming durable. The oldest clay tablets we know date back to the IV millennium BCE. 
<br>Tablet E29794 belongs to the Amarna Letters, a series of tablets found in 1888 in el-Amarna, modern name of Akhenaten, and dates back to the 14th century BCE. It reports the letter written from Tushratta, king of Mitanni (an area nowadays corresponding to northern Syria and Turkey), to Tiy (or Teye), Great Royal Wife of pharaoh Amenhotep III and mother of Akhenaten: the king hopes for stronger ties between the kingdoms. The text is written in cuneiform, and it has an important historical value, as it’s one of earliest examples of a queen being directly addressed in a written communication.

            <p class="intermediate long">Clay was an extremely common writing support in ancient times. It was inscribed with a bone or metal stylus and then either sun-dried or baked in a specific oven. The resulting tablets were durable and not particularly expensive: as such, they were especially apt for everyday uses, from diplomatic accounts to letters exchange. The type of clay is extremely helpful in determining the origin of a tablet: modern analyses of chemical components can help narrow down more precisely the geographical area where the clay was extracted, thus providing some important information on the possible origin of an exemplar. 
<br>Tablet E29794 is a clay tablet belonging to the so-called Amarna Letters, a series of tablets discovered in 1888 in el-Amarna, modern name of Akhetaten, the capital city funded by the Pharaoh Akhenaten (or Amenhotep IV) and abandoned after his death. The tablets contain rich information on the political and diplomatic relationships of the territory in the 14th century. Of great importance are the exemplars that testify to the rebellions and uprising in different parts of the kingdom. Tablet E29794 preserves the letter written from Tushratta, king of Mitanni (an area nowadays corresponding to northern Syria and Turkey), to the Tiy (or Teye), queen of Egypt and mother of Akhenaten: the letter recalls the friendship between the royal houses of the kingdoms and wishes to strengthen it.

</p>
            <p class="advanced long">Clay tablets were extremely popular writing supports, used extensively in Mesopotamia ever since the late 4th millennium BCE. Their size and format varied depending on the intended function: small tablets mostly recorded administrative transactions, inventories, and receipts, while larger tablets were used for legal contracts, lexical lists, scientific texts, and literary compositions. On them, the inscribed text would often follow ruled lines; some tablets included colophons, seals, or envelopes of clay for authentication and security.
<br>Clay’s physical properties made tablets particularly resistant and durable: unlike organic materials, such as papyrus, parchment or wood, clay is not susceptible to rot or biodegradation and is mostly not interested by the attack of insects and fungi. Under stable, favorable burial conditions, clay tablets thus can be preserved with little damage; extreme temperatures and high humidity, however, can affect them greatly. Clay’s composition can also be analyzed to determine the origin of tablets and the geographical source: the chemical composition of clay varies depending on its local environment and on the concentration of its mineral content.

                <p class="long">In ancient times, papyrus was used as writing support probably since the 3rd millennium BCE. It was made from the papyrus plant, a tall, tender aquatic plant especially found in areas with abundant, direct sunlight: it was extremely common in the Nile delta, as well in the Mediterranean area. Egyptians used every part of the plant, and with different purposes: papyrus could be used to create blankets, baskets, incense. The most common use was to create the papyrus “paper”: the plant’s pith (a soft material found inside the stem) was cut in strips, and the strips were then placed side by side and on top of each other. The resulting sheet was then dried and refined; multiple sheets were tied together in a roll, or scroll, for easy storage. <br>

             <p class="intermediate short"> Papyrus was an extremely popular writing support, obtained from an aquatic plant easily found in the Nile Delta. Papyrus sheets were produced by organizing the strips obtained from the inner pith of the plant. </p>
            <p class="intermediate medium">Extremely popular, papyrus was the principal writing support in ancient Egypt and in the Mediterranean areas, where the plant it was obtained from was easily available. Like clay, it is better preserved in arid environments, as it is susceptible to humidity. <br>
             The papyrus sheets were obtained by processing the pith of the plant: the strips were organized perpendicularly and in multiple layers, which would be then pressed together to create a single sheet. The obtained “page” was then dried and polished. Papyrus sheets would then usually be bound together to form scrolls. <br>
              As clay tablets, papyrus was used for almost any document: from legal and religious texts to business transactions and records, papyrus sheets could contain any type of text, making them an extremely important source of information for understanding the everyday life and historical contingencies of their writers. <br> 
             Used extensively across the Mediterranean and Near East, around the 4th century CE it started being slowly substituted by parchment, which was more durable, although more expensive and difficult to make.
            </p>
            <p class="intermediate long">Papyrus was an extremely popular writing support: the aquatic plant it is obtained from was greatly abundant in the Nile Delta, making it highly available and accessible. The papyrus sheets were produced by cutting the plant’s internal pith and arranging the resulting strips in perpendicular layers. The layers would be pressed one on top of the other, creating a singular, thicker sheet; once dried, the resulting sheet would be polished to increase the smoothness of the surface. Depending on the size of the sheet and its finish, different qualities of papyrus existed. Multiples sheets would be tied to create long scrolls, easy to carry around and to store; writing was typically done with ink and reed pens. <br>
                Papyrus was cheap and easy to make, but it’s also more rigid than other supports and more sensitive to humidity: by the 4th century, its use in Europe started to diminish, as parchment, a material obtained from animals’ skin, became more common. More difficult to create and expensive, parchment was, in fact, more resistant to European climates and more readily available.

            <p class="advanced short">Papyrus is obtained from the internal pith of the Cyperus papyrus L., an aquatic sedge abundantly found in the Nile Delta. It was typically inked with reed pens and organized in volumina. As it is susceptible to humidity and biological agents, it’s best preserved in arid environments. </p>
            <p class="advanced medium">Papyrus sheets are obtained from the processing of the internal pith of the Cyperus papyrus L., an aquatic sedge native to the Nile Delta and found in other areas of the Mediterranean. The interior would be cut into strips, which would be then arranged perpendicularly to strengthen the resulting sheet. Multiple papyrus sheets would usually be bound together into volumina: the text would be written in columns perpendicular to the scroll’s length. <br>
                Papyrus sheets were usually inked with reed pens; the ink tended to adhere to the surface, rather than seeping into the page. Its peculiar physical characteristics made papyrus particularly susceptible to humidity and biological agents, like fungi and insects; it is thus better preserved in arid environments, prone to low humidity and stable temperatures. 
            </p>
            <p class="advanced long">Papyrus is obtained from Cyperus papyrus L., an aquatic sedge native to the Nile Delta and easily found in northeastern Africa and some other areas of the Mediterranean. The plant, which can typically grow 2 to 5 meters tall, consists of a triangular, woody stem, and a spongy interior, which is the primary material used for papyrus production. <br>
                 Papyrus would cater to different practical needs: it would be used as a writing support, as well as wrapping paper for packaging objects and for the creation of mummies’ masks and coffins. <br>
                 The production of papyrus sheets was extremely important in ancient Egypt and became a standardized craft as early as the 3rd millennium BCE. The harvested plants would be deprived of the outer rind; the internal pith would be then sliced into thin strips (usually 1-2 cm wide). The strips would be arranged perpendicularly: a first layer would be laid horizontally on a flat surface, with the strips organized one next to the other; the second layer would be placed on top on the first one, but vertically, creating a cross-laminated scheme. The layers would then be dampened with water: this step was crucial to activating the sugars, primarily polysaccharides, that made the strips adhere to one another. The obtained sheet would then be pressed and dried, then smoothed with stones or shells. <br>
                 The resulting sheet was typically inked with carbon-based inks and reed pens. However, as papyrus has limited absorbency, the ink tended to adhere to the surface rather than being absorbed into the sheet; consequently, ink was extremely vulnerable to abrasion and flaking. However, under favorable conditions, the same mechanism contributes to guaranteeing a long-term preservation of the text. <br>
                 Papyrus sheets were commonly bound in volumina, achieving incredible lengths, up to 20 meters; the contained text would be arranged in columns perpendicular to the scroll’s length. In later years, they would also be used in codices, even if their low flexibility made them less suitable than parchment. <br>
                 Different qualities of papyrus paper existed: Pliny the Elder recounts the existence of different types, with regards to the sheet width, the fiber regularity and the sheet finish.  <br>
                 Due to its physical characteristics, papyrus is sensitive to humidity, mechanical stress and biological agents like fungi and insects; to be properly preserved, its needs stable temperatures and low humidity, making arid environments, like Egypt, the most favorable sites for its preservation. <br>

            <p class="long">Alongside clay, wood was also a popular writing support: very common in the Mediterranean areas and, in particular, among the Romans, it was relatively cheap, depending on its availability, and easy to use, but less durable than clay and more likely to be damaged by humidity. Wooden tablets could be of two types: the most common were rectangular, regular tablets where texts would be written with an ink pen- a pointy tool in metal- and liquid ink, but wax tablets were also common, especially for teaching. Wax tablets were realized by obtaining an empty, carved space in the tablet, which would then be filled with wax. The text would then been carved on the wax with a stylus and, if needed, it’d been cancelled by evening out again the wax surface. <br>

             <p class="intermediate short"> Alongside clay, wood was a primary writing material, especially in the Mediterranean regions. Wooden tablets could be inked with ink pens or, if covered in beeswax, carved with a stylus; as they were more susceptible to damage, especially due to humidity, they are less likely to be preserved in modern times. <br>
               The exhibited tablet belongs to the Vindolanda tablets, a group of wooden tablets discovered in Vindolanda, a Roman fort in England. Mostly dated to the 1st century CE, their contents range from military-based reports to everyday letters and messages. This tablet, relatively well-preserved and probably the most famous, contains the birthday invitation from a woman to her friend.

            <p class="intermediate medium">In the Mediterranean areas, wood was a truly important writing medium: Greeks, Egyptians and Romans, in particular, used it to create lightweight, portable tablets, perfect for record-keeping, correspondence, teaching. <br>
Wooden tablets were usually inked: inkpens, in metal or of reed, inkwells to store ink and penknives to sharpen the pointy end of the pens were the indispensable tools to write with. Wax tablets, however, were not unheard of: a recess would be carved inside the tablet and then filled with beeswax, allowing the texts, usually carved with a metal stylus, to be cancelled in case of mistakes. <br>
Although durable, wooden tablets were susceptible to damage, and difficult to preserve: that’s one of reason why the 1,700 wooden tablets found in Vindolanda, northern England, are of extreme importance. The tablets give detailed insights on the life in an auxiliary roman fort near Hadrian’s Wall, attesting both for the military and everyday aspects of life in the 1st-3rd centuries CE. <br>
This particular exemplar is one of the most complete and better preserved. It is, additionally, one of the earliest evidence of women handwriting in the Roman Empire. In it, Claudia Severa, wife of a fort’s commander, invites her friend Sulpicia Lepidina to her birthday party.

            <p class="intermediate long">In the Mediterranean areas, wood was a truly important writing medium: Greeks, Egyptians and Romans, in particular, used it to create lightweight, portable tablets, suitable for redacting legal and administrative documents and correspondence and for teaching. <br>
There were two main types of wooden tablets: the first, and most common, was a wooden block, of rectangular shape, on which surface one could write with an inkpen, made of metal or of reed, dipped in the liquid ink stored in the inkwell. In case of reed pens, their nibs used to wear out frequently: hence, a penknife was usually necessary to resharpen it. The second version, especially apt for teaching purposes, was the wooden tablet: the tablets would be cut to create an internal recess, then filled with beeswax. The wax would be carved with a stylus and, if necessary, could be smoothed out, hence deleting the text. <br>
Usually, tablets were tied together, with strings or leather, to obtain a sort of book, called diptychs (in case of two tablets tied together) or triptychs (in case of three). <br>
As they are usually damaged by the passing of time, great findings like the one in Vindolanda, northern England, are quite rare: more than 1,700 tablets have been unearthed since the 1970s and are now studied and preserved. The information contained in them can help paint the reality of life in an auxiliary roman camp of the 1st-3rd centuries CE: military recordings and everyday life’s activities are thereby recorded and, along with the many other findings of the site, can give precious insights on life near Hadrian’s Wall. <br>
This particular exemplar reads a birthday invitation from Claudia Severa, wife of a fort’s commander, to her friend, Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of the Vindolanda fort’s commander: as Claudia Severa herself writes the concluding farewell, the tablet contains one of the earliest examples of woman handwriting in the Roman Empire.

            <p class="advanced short">Wooden tablets were also extremely popular in the Mediterranean areas, albeit less durable: the Vindolanda tablets, for example, were preserved thanks to specific anaerobic conditions, which prevented fatal damage. Chemical analysis of the employed wood can help trace the provenience of an exemplar. </p>
            <p class="advanced medium">Wooden tablets were especially common in the Mediterranean regions, where weather conditions made them accessible and durable. <br>
Wooden tablets were usually inked, while their variants, wax tablets, were carved: in absence of tablets’ traces, inkpens and styli could be important witnesses of their original presence. Size and thickness of the tablets and the type of wood varied greatly, due to local availability and the desired final uses. Chemical analysis on the tablets can help identify the wood’s variety and trace the provenience of tablet itself. <br>
Albeit susceptible to decay, a considerable number of tablets have been preserved to modern times: one of the most significant findings is located in Vindolanda, northern England. Although damaged, most of the tablets appear relatively well-preserved: their conditions can be explained by the specific anaerobic circumstances that prevented excessive damage. <br>
The tablets, alongside the other findings, are fundamental in drawing a detailed picture of life in the roman fort in the 1st-3rd centuries CE. This exemplar is one of the most well-preserved tablets: it contains a birthday invitation from Claudia Severa, wife of a fort’s commander, to Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of the Vindolanda’s commander Flavius Cerealis. Although most of the text is written by a different hand, the concluding remarks are written by Clauda Severa herself, making it one of earliest examples of women handwriting in the Roman Empire.

            <p class="short">  In ancient times, pens did not contain ink: to write, they were dipped into liquid ink, kept in specific containers, called inkwells.

            <p class="medium"> Originally, pens didn’t contain any ink: instead, to write they were constantly dipped into inkwells, small containers made of different materials, used to store and keep liquid ink. Black inks were the most common, albeit reds, blues and golds were also used. This particular inkwell is a pottery container dated from the 1st-3rd century, in Roman Britain. Inscribed is the name of its owner, Iucundus, which means cheerful. </p>
            <p class="long"> Differently from nowadays’ pens, the ancient writing instruments could not store ink: to write, they had to be frequently dipped into liquid ink. Traditionally, in most Mediterranean cultures the ink was stored in an inkwell, a small, oval-shaped container: usually it was made of metal or ceramics, but glass and silver inkwells were not unknown. A small lid was used to prevent the ink from hardening or being contaminated with dust. Black inks were the most common; colorful ones, like red, blue or gold, were not unheard of, but they were rarer, as they were more expensive. As such, they were used mostly for political or religious texts. Inkwells were most commonly used with reed pens, obtained from reed straws: the straw was cut at one of its ends, which was then used to write on the surface. As they tended to lose their sharpness, the pointy ends, or nibs, were frequently resharpened with penknives. <br>

Black ink was the most common and was used prevalently with papyrus and parchment. </p>
            <p class="intermediate medium"> As ink pens could not hold the ink internally, inkwells were crucial instruments for writing. Typically made of ceramics or metal, they usually had a lid, to prevent ink spilling or contamination. Clay inkwells were typically plain, while metal inkwells could be richly decorated. Black ink was the most used: colorful inks were also appreciated, but their cost made them more suited for important documents and texts. Black ink could be carbon-based, obtained from soot, or mineral based: the latter worked better for parchment, but could damage the writing support or undergo oxidation. Ink pens, on the other hand, were mostly made of metal or of reeds; in this case, their frequent use tended to damage the nibs, which needed to be resharpened.  </p>

The process for creating ink was extremely delicate: to achieve the desired color and density, the materials needed to be mixed carefully and in the correct proportions.

            <p class="advanced short">Traditionally, inks could be stored as liquids or as solids. In the Mediterranean, especially among the Greeks and Romans, ink was stored as a liquid, and thus inkwells were fundamental. Inkwells were specifically designed to prevent ink corrosion and evaporation. They were mostly made of clay and metal alloys, but other durable materials could be used. The most common ink was a carbon-based, black ink, while in later centuries the iron-gall black ink was preferred. </p>
            <p class="advanced medium"> In the Mediterranean, where ink would be usually kept as a liquid, inkwells were crucial writing tools. Inkwells could be manufactured from different materials, especially clay and metal alloys; the choice of the material was instrumental to prevent ink absorption or corrosion. Typically, they had a compact body with a narrower neck and could present a lid to prevent ink evaporation and hardening. <br>
Traditionally, the most used ink was a carbon-based, black ink, while in later centuries iron-gall black ink was preferred, as it interacted better with parchment. Reds, blues, golds and silvers were also common, albeit less so: more expensive, they were adopted only for religious or extremely important public texts. Inks were applied with ink pens, in metal or of reeds. 
</p>
            <p class="advanced long"> Inkpens and inkwells were the necessary instruments to write on many different supports. Inkwells were manufactured from varying durable materials, including fired clay, stone, glass – although rarely-, bronze and copper alloys, selected for their resistance to corrosion and ink absorption. Metal inkwells could be rich in decorations.  Although their shape may change greatly, they usually had a compact body with a narrow neck, as to minimize spillage and ink evaporation and contamination. Additionally, inkwells could have lids, to prevent ink from hardening. <br>
The ink stored within was commonly carbon-based, obtained from ground soot or charcoal mixed with water and a binding material, like gum arabic, Arabic resin or egg albumin. The proportion of carbon to binding material was fundamental for the ink’s consistency and opacity.  This ink was chemically stable and stood easily to the test of time. Another important type of ink, albeit more recent and used predominantly in the medieval period, was iron-gall ink, a mineral ink based on tannins extracted from plants combined with iron salts. The resulting ink tended to interact with the surface, becoming darker and more resistance to fading, but could also undergo changes due to oxidation or corrode the writing support. As it worked extremely well on parchment, it became the preferred choice later in antiquity. Inks were carefully made when needed; good proportions, grinding and filtration of the ingredients were necessary to achieve the wanted viscosity and color. <br>
Colored inks were not unheard of, but typically they were more expensive: the most common were red, obtained from cinnabar or red ochre, and blue, obtained from indigo; gold and silver were also used. <br>
Inks were usually applied with an ink pen, either in metal or made of reed. Both were hollow inside, allowing for ink to be temporarily stored in the nibs. As reed pens wore out easily, it was necessary to resharpen their nibs frequently, using the proper metal penknife. <br>

            <p class="short"> Probably the most well-known writing support, paper was extremely appreciated, as it was very lightweight and easy to carry and use. First invented and introduced in China, traditionally it is said to be created by Cai Lun in the 1st century CE, during the Han Dinasty, but some older exemplars have been found. </p>
            <p class="medium"> As for writing supports, paper is the most common and most widely used. It was invented in China and rapidly became the preferred support, as it was cheaper and easier to use than the two most common materials in ancient China, bamboo and silk. Traditionally, its invention is attributed to Cai Lun, an imperial official during the Han Dinasty: however, nowadays it is believed to have been invented even before. Cai Lun used different materials to create paper sheets: he used tree barks and vegetal fibers, mixed with old rags and fishing nets. These materials were mixed together, made into a pulp, pressed and then dried. </p>
            <p class="long"> Paper is, for sure, the most common and well-known writing support. Cheap, easy to produce in huge quantities and to use, light and thin, it readily spread across countries and continents to become the preferred medium for storing knowledge, ensuring communication and distributing information. Paper was invented in China and quickly replaced bamboo scrolls and silk as the preferred writing support, as it was easier to handle and cheaper. Traditionally, its creation is attributed to Cai Lun, an imperial officer during the Han Dinasty, in the 1st century CE: we now know that it was probably created even before. From China, paper was introduced in Korea and Japan and then, after the Battle of Talas (751 CE), in the Islamic caliphate in West Asia; then, through Islamic Spain, it reached Europe, where parchment was still the preferred choice. In the 15th century, as the printing process became easier and the business for books grew larger and larger, paper, as the cheaper support, replaced parchment as the most common writing support. <br>
Traditionally, paper is made of plant-based materials and from textiles. Cai Lun is said to have used a mixture of both: bark and fibers from plant mixed with old rags and fishing nets. In the 19th century, however, as the production of paper increased still, rags and textiles were replaced entirely with wood pulp, to make the process cheaper and less complicated. This change, however, increased exponentially the impact of paper making on the environment.

            <p class="intermediate short">  Paper is probably the first material to come to mind when talking about writing and reading. Cheap and easy to produce, ever since its invention paper was used both as a writing support and as a main material for objects of everyday use. Invented in China, in the early 2nd century BCE, it spread across countries through trade routes and conflicts, quickly becoming essential for everyday life and activities. </p>
            <p class="intermediate medium"> For centuries, communication, reading and writing have been indivisible from paper. Cheap, easier to produce than most early material and convenient to use and store, it quickly became the preferred medium for any kind of document, both in public and private daily life. Invented in China as early as the 2nd century BCE, its refinement and diffusion is attributed to Cai Lun, an imperial officer during the Han Dynasty who improved paper’s composition by integrating different natural materials. </p>
            <p class="intermediate long"> Not many materials have shaped the world quite like paper: from books and documents to everyday objects (even clothes!), paper is an undeniable staple in daily life, even now in the digital era. 
Paper as we know it has a long history, rooted in China: used as early as the 2nd century BCE, it was innovated and refined in the early 2nd century CE by Cai Lun, an imperial officer during the Han Dynasty, who improved paper quality by combining hemp fibers with rags, mulberry bark and fishnets. The resulting paper quickly replaced silk and bamboo as the main writing support. As it spread across the world through trade routes, it quickly became the preferred medium to create any kind of resource, from court laws and notices to private correspondence between families and friends. 
Paper is obtained from the natural fibers of rags and barks, accurately processed to create regular, high-quality paper sheets. Through the centuries, its composition changed, both in light of innovations in production processes and of the increasing demand of paper-based books and products. 
 </p>
            </div>

            <div class="advanced">
            <p class="advanced short"> Paper is an exceptionally important support, evolving from a handcrafted medium to an industrial product. As its production increased, so did its environmental impact, prevalently in terms of deforestation and water usage. However, sustainable practices are increasingly being adopted. </p>
            <p class="advanced medium"> Traditionally, the invention of paper is attributed to Cai Lun, an imperial officer in ancient China around 105 CE; later findings led to believe, however, that its invention predated the 1st century CE. Originally obtained from bark, hemp and rags, the papermaking process involved multiple steps, in which the materials had to be converted into a pulp and the pulp cleaned, refined, and then pressed. In the 18th century, technological improvements sped up the process, thus increasing paper production and availability. <br>
As paper production and use increased, the impact of paper making on the environment grew significantly, with greater risks of deforestation and water consumption. Sustainable practices, like recycling and cleaner production processes, are actively trying to minimize the risk, and sustain a greener lifecycle for paper products. 
</p>
            <p class="advanced long"> Traditionally, the origin of paper is traced back to ancient China around 105 CE, attributed to Cai Lun, an imperial eunuch during the Han Dynasty; nowadays, recent findings led to believe that paper was invented and used even before the 1st century CE.  Over time, paper spread to the Middle East and Europe through trade routes, eventually reaching the rest of the world. <br>
Early paper was made from a mixture of mulberry bark, hemp fibers and rags. As demand grew in later centuries, wood pulp became the preferred source for papermaking, as it was less expensive and its use simplified the production process.   <br>
To create paper, the source materials had to be converted into pulp, either through mechanical pulping, which ground the materials, or through chemical pulping, which used chemicals to break their fibers’ bonds. The obtained pulp had to be filtered to remove residuals and impurities.  A paper mould, consisting of a mesh made of brass, steel or synthetic fiber, framed by a wooden structure, is then immersed in the pulp: the process formed a uniform layer of material on top of the mesh. The resulting sheets were then dried and cut to the desired shape.  In the late 18th century, the process of papermaking was revolutionized by the Fourdrinier machine, capable of creating a continuous sheet of paper: the introduction of the machine lowered the costs of papermaking, thus increasing its production and consequently its availability. <br>
As paper became crucial to everyday activities, its production and use started to take a heavy toll on the environment: the increasing need for wood pulp led to intense exploitation of forests, with consequential great impact on local biodiversity, on the production of carbon emissions and on the levels of soil erosion. Additionally, as the papermaking requires water during paper production, the risk of excessive water consumption is a reasonable concern, as well as risks of water pollution. Modern practices, however, are now trying and succeeding to minimize the risks and increase sustainability: the use of recycled materials and cleaner production chains can significantly reduce the environmental costs.

            <p class="medium"> Inkstones were fundamental instruments for Chinese calligraphy. Inks were stored in solid forms, called inksticks; to be used for writing, they were grinded on the inkstones with some water. The brushes were then dipped in the resulting ink and used to write or draw on paper. Inkstones were made most commonly of stone: the choice of material was critical, as it affected the quality of the obtained ink. As the most sought-after stones were difficult to extract, inkstones could be extremely expensive. Usually, they were also decorated with complex, beautiful designs. <br>

Still used today, they consist of a flat part and a hollow one: the inksticks, solid inks, were grinded with some water on the flat part, while the obtained liquid ink was collected in the hollow part. The quality of the material used to create the inkstone affected the quality of the ink: hence, the choice of the material was crucial. Usually, sedimentary or underwater volcanic rocks were used; the most sought-after inkstones came from the area of Guangdong, in south China. Four inkstones are especially known and appreciated: the Duan inkstones, made of volcanic rock of a purplish color; the She inkstones, of similar volcanic rock, but in a black shade and gold fragments; the Taohe inkstones, crystalline inkstones made from stones from the Tao River; Chengni inkstones, ceramic-made inkstones.

            <p class="intermediate long"> While in the Mediterranean areas inks were usually stored in inkwells as liquids, in East Asia they would be stored in solid inksticks or ink cakes: when needed, they would be grinded on an inkstone and mixed with water, hence becoming liquid. Inkstones were then a fundamental element of a writer’s writing kit. <br>
Inkstones were usually made of fine-grained stone, to allow efficient grinding and minimizing damage to the inkstone itself. More rarely, they could be made from clay or ceramic. Typically in a rectangular or oval shape, they usually present a flat surface where to grind the inksticks and hollow recess to store the obtained liquid ink. Depending on the richness of the color and the density required, the grinding could be more or less throughout; the amount of water used could also affect the resulting ink. After the use, the inkstone needed to be cleaned carefully, to eliminate eventual ink residuals, which could affect further productions. <br>

            <p class="advanced short"> Inkstones, inksticks, paper and brushes, the Four Treasures of the Study, are the fundamental tools for calligraphy in East Asia. Inkstones and inksticks, in particular, were renowned for their quality and beautiful decorations. </p>
            <p class="advanced medium"> Inkstones were a key part of the Four Treasure of the Study, along with inksticks, brushes and paper. Inksticks were obtained combining soot and binding agent, usually gum arabic; the proportion of the ingredients affected the color richness and density. Once dried, the inksticks could be decorated. The inkstones, on the other hand, were made mostly of stone, the quality of which affected the resulting ink. The most sought-after inkstones came from the area of Guangdong, in south China.</p>
            <p class="advanced long"> Differently from the Mediterranean liquid inks and inkwells, in East Asia inks were stored as solid inksticks and ground on inkstone to create liquid ink, suitable for use. <br>
Inksticks were typically made combining soot, often obtained from burning oil or plan resins, and a binding agent; traditionally, the chosen binding agent was gum arabic, but in higher-quality inks animal-based gelatin or starch might be preferred. Additionally, incense of herbs could be added to modify the ink’s fragrance and consistency. The proportion of soot to binder was fundamental in determining the resulting quality of the ink. <br>
 The obtained mixture was molded into small, solid sticks, typically in a rectangular or cylindrical shape. Their sizes could vary, as their appearance: while they were often plain, inksticks could be beautifully decorated. After they had been shaped, the inksticks were left to dry. Each inkstick could last for a long time, and weather even years of regular use. <br>
Inkstones were extremely valued for their beauty and quality. In China, the earliest examples date back to the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE); their quality and craftmanship evolved and refined throughout the centuries, reaching their peak during the Ming (1368–1644 CE) and Qing (1644–1912 CE) Dynasties. Alternatively, Japanese inkstones could be simpler in designs, as they were valued for their practicality: the most well-known type is the Tokoname inkstone, made of local clay and particularly appreciated for its smoothness. Korean inkstones were, too, renowned for their quality and durability. <br>
The type of stone was fundamental: its surface could not be extremely smooth, as it would obstacle grinding, but needed to be resistant enough to prevent damage due to use. The most sought-after inkstones came from the area of Guangdong, in south China. Four inkstones were especially known and appreciated: the Duan inkstones, made of volcanic rock of a purplish color; the She inkstones, of similar volcanic rock, but in a black shade and gold fragments; the Taohe inkstones, crystalline inkstones made from stones from the Tao River; Chengni inkstones, ceramic-made inkstones.

            <p class="short">  The movable type print is a technique for printing that combines metal types- small blocks each representing an individual letter or character- to form longer texts and to create thousands of reproductions of the same text. In Europe, it was invented and refined by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century.</p>
            <p class="medium"> One of the greatest, if not the greatest, inventions of the 15th century, movable type printing is an efficient printing method that allowed to make copies of the same texts in an easier, faster and cheaper way. Unlike xylography, in which each wooden block was used to print only one specific text or image, in the movable type print the same basic tools can be reused almost infinitely to reproduce each different page of each different book. Those basic tools were the types, small metal blocks, where each type represented a specific letter of the alphabet: the printer could then rearrange the types in whatever order and create different words, phrases, texts. </p>
            <p class="long"> Before the 15th century, making multiple copies of a single text was a long, complex process, done mostly by hand. Typically, this process was reserved for religious texts or important scholarly books; the resulting copies were carefully crafted, but often very expensive and different from one another, as the copying process was not simple and scribes (those who typically copied books by hand) could easily make mistakes. This last problem was partly solved by xylography, as all copies of a page were created by using the same wooden block, ensuring they were identical or almost; but the carving process was long, expensive and needed plenty of resources. For long, text-heavy books, this process could become impracticable. <br>
The movable type print revolutionized the printing process by focusing on the creation of metal stamps not for the single page, but for the single letter: each small block, or type, would represent a letter or character, and the printer could then rearrange the needed types to create each different page. The same types could be used over and over to create all different texts: the printing process became fast, cheaper and reliable, able to produce hundreds and thousands of identical copies of many different texts.<br>
Modern movable type was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 1450s, leading to large-scale, fast and cheap book production in Europe. A similar system, however, was already known in China and Korea. 
</p>
            </div>

            <div class="intermediate">
            <p class="intermediate short">The invention of the movable type print had an indescribable impact on culture and knowledge, allowing an easier and wider diffusion of literacy and information. It consisted of arranging individual, movable casts, each representing an alphabetic symbol, into lines or pages that were then transferred on paper, allowing to produce hundreds of copies of the same text. </p>
            <p class="intermediate medium"> The metal movable type, the printing system invented by J. Gutenberg in the 15th century, allowed to produce books faster and more cheaply, helping spread knowledge, literacy and ideas. Instead of creating a matrix for each page that had to be reproduced, it used individual letters or characters, rearranging and reusing them as needed. This intuition made the printing process faster and less resource-consuming, encouraging the creation of mass market for scholarly books and literary texts. </p>
            <p class="intermediate long"> The invention of the movable type print is often referred to as a pivotal moment for the evolution of culture and knowledge, with a significant impact also on the economic, scientific, religious and political spheres.  The new printing system, in fact, simplified and sped up the books production process, allowing for the mass production of cultural and literary objects: books became cheaper, widely accessible and easily reproducible in fixed versions, which encouraged the spread of knowledge and transformed reading into a personal, accessible and ordinary activity.  <br>
Differently from xylography, movable type print consisted in the creation of individual metal casts for each letter of the alphabet, which would then be organized and arranged into the intended lines or pages. The same letters’ casts could then be reused and rearranged to create different pages and mistakes could be easily fixed by swapping single letters, without the need to create ex novo a specific cast for that specific line. The system, thus, was more efficient and less resource-consuming, and allowed for increased flexibility and scalability.<br>
The rise of Gutenberg’s system was favored also by the specific cultural conditions of 15th century Europe: the progress of universities and bureaucracies pushed for higher education and literacy levels, which, in turn, led to a growing demand for scholarly books and literary texts. The movable type print allowed for easy, fast production of these texts, but at the same time it also encouraged and expanded the market for commercial books. By 1500, over 250 European cities had their own printing presses. <br>
Gutenberg’s printing system, however, was not equally successful in all countries: while it was extremely suited for small, alphabetical scripts, like those used in many European countries, it didn’t work quite as well with large characters sets, like Chinese. Thus, xylography remained extremely important in East Asia.

            <p class="advanced short"> With his inventions, J. Gutenberg refined and improved the movable type printing system, leading to the creation of a large-scale market and the diffusion of knowledge and literacy. His key invention is probably the hand mold, which allowed to make large quantities of cheap copies of letter-punches.  </p>
            <p class="advanced medium"> Movable type printing revolutionized the way books were made, sold and read in Europe. Already known in East Asia, in Europe it was invented and refined by J. Gutenberg, who, in the 15th century, combined new technologies and materials to create modern movable type printing. In particular, he introduced the hand mold, with which it was possible to create large quantities of letterpunches at low costs. He also introduced a mechanical press, which allowed for a uniform, reproducible and faster printing process. <br>
The first book to be ever printed with this method was the Bible: Gutenberg printed 180 copies of it, each copy now regarded as a pivotal testimonial to a radical cultural change. 
</p>
            <p class="advanced long"> J. Gutenberg’s movable type revolutionized the printing system and encouraged the creation of a large-scale books market and the diffusion of literacy, knowledge and new ideas.  <br>
Movable type printing was already known in East Asia: during the Northern Song dynasty, Bi Sheng (990-1051), an artisan and engineer, used ceramic types to make hundreds of reproductions of the same text.  Bi Sheng had also invented the wooden movable type, which overcame many of the complexities of traditional woodcut printing. By the 12th century, metal movable types were used, as well. <br>
The invention of the modern movable type printing system is traditionally attributed to Johannes Gutenberg; Gutenberg, who is believed to have developed this system independently, used his knowledge and craft as a goldsmith to create and refine a printing process that could simplify book production.  <br>
Gutenberg’s movable type combined several technologies into a single, reproducible system. In realizing his printing system, Gutenberg introduced many innovations: first of all, he developed a durable alloy made of lead, tin and antimony, which had a low melting point and was durable enough to last through thousands of impressions. The low melting point also simplified the casting procedures. As for the typecasting device, he introduced the hand mold, which allowed to rapidly cast identical letters, leading to the creation of uniform types. Gutenberg also adopted a different kind of ink: as traditional water-based inks were unsuitable for metal casts, he opted for oil-based inks that interacted better with metal and transferred cleanly to paper. Lastly, for the printing press he took inspiration from existing screw presses, typically used in papermaking, which provided even, uniform and repeatable pressure and helped sped up production’s times. <br>
Gutenberg’s earliest typefaces tended to imitate manuscripts and, in particular, their scripts, mostly to provoke a sense of familiarity among readers. Pages were designed to resemble manuscripts: as such, they were organized into two columns, contained justified text and allowed for hand-painted initial letters and rubrication. <br>
The Gutenberg’s Bible is the first, and probably most famous, product of Gutenberg’s press: Gutenberg realized 180 copies, mostly in paper but also in vellum, all with consistent typography and combining printed text and hand illumination.

                <p class="short"> Xylography is an early printing technique which used wooden blocks to create many copies of an image or a text. Each block was carved to represent the desired text and then covered in ink; the writing support was then pressed onto the block, obtaining a print of the intended object. </p>
                <p class="medium">Xylography, or woodcut, is an early printing technique used to make copies of a text or image. The key step was to properly carve the wooden block, used as a stamp: the uncarved surface was covered in ink and used to create a print of the intended document on the writing support. Originated in 7th century China, it later became extremely common in Japan and in Europe. </p>
                <p class="long">All the writing supports and tools we have analyzed so far tried to explain how historically writers could go about producing one singular document. Texts were mostly handwritten; of course, copies of a document could have been made, but the copying process would usually take time, and was prone to mistakes, especially with long texts and literary works. <br>
Before moder printing revolutionized the production and distribution of written texts, an early printing process could help speed up the creation process: xylography. Xylography, literally “woodwriting” from ancient Greek, was an early printmaking technique used to create prints of images and texts. <br>
It probably originated in China, with examples dating back to the 7th century CE and then spread to other countries.  In Japan, where earliest examples date to the 8th century, it was originally used for religious documents and images and later evolved into a sophisticated art form. In Europe, xylography became a common technique in the late Middle Ages, especially for religious images and, before more modern printing took over, early books. <br>
At the basis of the process there was a wooden block: the printer, or an artist, would carve away the parts that should have not be printed. The uncarved surface would then be covered in ink, and the writing medium (usually paper or fabric) was then pressed onto the block. The text or image represented on the wooden block would then be transferred to the medium. This process allowed to make multiple copies of the same object: although it was mostly used for imagery, it also dealt with texts, carving entire pages into single woodblocks. <br>
The exhibited item is a later example of Chinese woodcut prints, which testifies both to the diffusion of the printing technique and to the beauty of the final object. At the same time, its use of colors, rarer in the Chinese tradition, marks it as an extremely remarkable art piece.

 Originated in China in the 7th century CE, it then spread across countries, each with their own styles and application. Chinese xylography was originally strictly connected to religious objects and productions, prioritizing texts and layout harmony; it later expanded to the production of educational and teaching text, which still emphasized elegant scripts and rich illustrations. In Japan, where the earliest examples date back to the 8th century CE, it evolved from a medium intended for producing religious texts and images to a renown, deeply appreciated and influencing art style with the 17th-19th centuries okiyo-e prints, known for their vibrant colors and beautiful illustrations. In Europe, xylography was introduced in the late Middle Ages and focused mostly on images: block books, which developed in the 15th century, were quickly set aside by the following technological printing innovations. However, in the 16th century in particular and, after a period of decline, in the 19th-20th centuries, European xylography was exalted as a specific art form. 
</p>
            <p class="intermediate long">Before moder printing revolutionized the production and distribution of written texts, xylography, an early printing technique, helped simplify the creation of multiple copies of the same object, laying the foundation for mass communication and later becoming a valued artistic medium in its own right.

The uncarved surface would then be covered in ink, and the writing medium (usually paper or fabric) was then pressed onto the block. The text or image represented on the wooden block would then be transferred to the medium. <br>
It probably originated in China, with examples dating back to the 7th century CE: originally, the woodblock prints were closely tied to Buddhism and, hence, to the religious context. The most famous early woodcut book is, in fact, the Diamon Sutra (868 CE, Tang dynasty), a religious text including texts and illustrations and often considered as the oldest printed book in the world. During the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE), xylography reached its golden age: as the demand for books grew and expanded to include more and more disciplines, printing became commercial, and its techniques were refined, leading to elegant, richly illustrated texts strongly inspired by calligraphy. Woodcut printing remained central even after movable types were introduced. <br>
While Chinese xylography tended to focus onto text and remained mostly in black and white, Japanese xylography became known, in later centuries, for its colorful images and prints, realized with the same woodcut technique. Originally, Japanese xylography was, as well, strictly connected to the religious context: in the 17th-19th centuries, however, xylography focused on illustrations and images, giving rise to Ukiyo-e, an artistic form renown and appreciated globally. <br>
In Europe, xylography was introduced and became a common technique in the late Middle Ages, circa 14th century, and it mostly focused on images. Originally, it was mostly used to create single prints of religious images and playing cards. Later, in the 15th century, it differentiated into block books, with the production of small books, which included both text and images, thought as visual teaching tools. This phase, however, was short-lived, as in the mid-15th century J. Gutenberg introduced the movable metal type, and xylography was once again adopted only for illustration. In the 16th century and, after a period of decline, in the 19th-20th centuries, it was elevated to a proper art form, appreciated for its expressive power. <br>
This exemplar is a remarkable item, testifying both to the diffusion of the printing technique and to the beauty of the final objects. Dating to the 17th century China, it’s renown for the extraordinary use of color and skilled craftmanship of its authors; the volume was created as a teaching instrument, covering both calligraphy and paintings of animals and flora.

            <p class="advanced short">Xylography is a relief printing technique originated in China, in the 7th century CE, later spreading to different countries, where it evolved and refined into different production styles and art forms. Crucial for the quality of the final products were the quality of wood and the craftmanship of the carver. </p>
            <p class="advanced medium">Xylography is a relief printing technique relying on carved wooden matrices to reproduce prints of texts or images on the intended support. The type of wood was crucial for the quality of the product and for the ease of the process: hardwoods like cherry and boxwood were less likely to splinter or to be damaged by humidity and thus were commonly chosen as the source materials. 
Xylography originated in China, in the 7th century CE, and quickly spread in East Asia and in Europe: in each country, it evolved differently, emphasizing the text or the image or preferring colors to the black and white. In Japan, it evolved into the renown art form ukiyo-e, while in Europe it became appreciated for its expressive power by the 16th century artists. 
</p>
            <p class="advanced long">Xylography is an early printmaking technique used to make reproductions of images and texts. Its key principle is relief printing: a wooden matrix is carved so that the intended image or text is left in relief. Ink is applied to the raised portion of the block; the print is transferred under pressure to the desired support. <br>
The resulting object was affected by the quality of wood and the tools used for carving the matrix: fine-grained hardwoods, like pear, boxwood and cherry, were preferred for their durability, which minimized the risks of cracks and splintering due to the cutting and that allowed for prolonged use of the matrix without loss of details, and for their resistance to humidity. Carving the wooden block was then a long, complex process, with required high levels of craftmanship and an eye for details. The type of ink tended to vary: in East Asia, water-based inks or pigments were commonly used, while in Europe oil-based inks were preferred. The type of paper varied, as well, with paper sheets being tendentially softer and handmade in East Asia and stiffer and more standardized in Europe. For color printing, multiple blocks representing the same subject were carved, each painted with one color and only in some specific areas; each block would then be used to create a complete copy. <br>
Xylography originated in China, in the 7th century CE, and was originally closely associated with the reproduction of Buddhist texts and images. It developed during the Tang and Song dynasties, enabling large-scale production and distribution of religious, scholarly and literary texts. Despite the invention of the movable type, xylography remained a prevalent technique, mostly due to its ability to preserve the aesthetic quality of calligraphy. In Japan, xylography evolved from religious and courtly printing into an image-centered artistic medium during the Edo period, culminating into Ukiyo-e, an artistic genre known for its vibrant colors and emphasis on popular urban culture. In Europe, xylography was introduced in the late 14th century, probably independently, although East Asian prints were already known through trade routes. It was originally used for religious images, and, for a short period, for block books; in the 16th century and, later, in the 19th-20th centuries it was valued and appreciated for its artistic and expressive quality. <br>
This exemplar is a remarkable item, testifying both to the diffusion of the printing technique and to the beauty of the final objects. Dating to the 17th century China, it was created as a teaching manual on calligraphy and miscellaneous natural objects, such as plum flowers and birds. Its outstanding colors and harmonious and complex drawings attest to the skill of the authors and painters.

                <p class="short"> Quills were the most important tool used to write in the Middle Ages. They were obtained by the feathers of different types of birds, geese’ in the first place.

                <p class="medium">Ever since the 6th century, quills became the preferred instrument to write. More flexible and durable than reed pens, they were the perfect choice to write on thicker supports, like parchment. They were obtained from birds’ feathers, especially geese’: more expensive and rarer were quills made of swans’ or crows’  feathers. As they could not contain ink, they had to be frequently dipped into liquid ink; if needed, a specific cut could be made to the pointy end- the nib- to control the ink’s flow and application. </p>
                <p class="long">More durable and practical than reed pens, quills quickly became the primary writing tool around the 6th century CE, especially in Europe. Their stronger flexibility and durability made them especially suitable for thicker supports, like parchment. As they grew in popularity, their use spread out: monks, lawyers, merchants, scientists and court officers, they all soon employed quills. Many of the most important texts of these centuries were written with quills: the Magna Carta, for example, as well as some of Leonardo da Vinci’s notes and sketches and Galileo Galilei’s scientific writings.  Their decline only started in the early 19th century, when new prototypes of pens that could contain ink were introduced. <br>

            <p class="intermediate medium">Quills were extremely common during the Middle Ages: as reed pens are usually associated with papyrus, so quills are associated with parchments. Quills were used since the 6th century CE, up until the introduction of the dip pen, which had a metal nib, and, later, of the fountain pen, which could hold ink in an internal reservoir. Quills were obtained from large birds’ shed flying feathers; penknives were used to further sharpen the nib. Although the quills did not contain ink reservoirs, they were hollow inside, so they could store more ink after dipping. Funnily, usually the quills did not keep the feathers, as is usually shown in movies: the feathery part, called barbs, were mostly or completely stripped away. </p>
            <p class="intermediate long">Quills were extremely common during the Middles Ages: as parchment became more common, so did quills. Quills were obtained from birds’ flight feathers, shed during the moult. Goose’ feathers were the most common, as well as swans’ feathers and crows’ feathers, the latter being especially useful for fine, detailed work. The end of the quill was sharpened to create the nib; as it tended to wear down easily, penknives were used to resharpen it when necessary. Funnily, quills did not keep the feathers, as the movies and the common imaginary would tell: the feathers, called barbs, were almost completely stripped down, and partially kept for fashion reasons only in the later centuries. Quills were used with inkwells, as they could not hold internal ink reservoirs. As the metal dip pens, and, more importantly, the fountain pens were introduced, the quill was slowly abandoned.  </p>

            <p class="advanced short">To create quills, large flying feathers were the preferred choice.

The writer needed to apply the correct amount of pressure, to prevent damage to the nib and to ensure the correct flow of ink on the page. </p>
            <p class="advanced long">To create a proper, high-quality quill, the choice of feathers was crucial. Usually, large flying feathers, shed during the molt, were the preferred choice; the feather’s shaft (or rachis) had to be strong, but flexible. Once the feather was chosen, it had to be dried for a prolong period of time, usually for weeks: the drying process made them sturdier and firmer. The nib had then to be cut by hand, usually using a small knife, and at a precise angle; an additional cut was made down the center to control ink flow through capillary action. The width of the cut could affect whether the writing would tend to be thinner or bolder. <br>
The ink would be deposited inside, in the hollow rachis, and along the cuts: surface tension and gravity would control how it moves across the writing supports. To properly use it, writers had to be careful on how much pressure they applied: too much pressure could split the nib, while too little would obstacle the ink flow. <br>
The quills’ peculiarities allowed scribes to create smooth curves and lines of different depths, leading to the refining of famous writing styles, like Carolingian minuscule and Gothic Script.

The first, experimental prototypes of fountain pens predate significantly the 19th century: both in 10th century CE Arab Egypt and Renaissance Italy some prototypes are said to be made, even if no traces are left. The first patents were issued in the 19th century; the first design to achieve commercial success was the 1819 John Scheffer’s fountain pen. </p>

             <p class="intermediate short">Fountain pens, the first to hold ink internally, were introduced, perfected and widely adopted in the 19th-20th centuries. They allowed for smoother, simpler writing, and would become status symbols. </p>
            <p class="intermediate medium">Fountain pens are writing tools that can hold ink internally: unlike reed pens or quills, they don’t thus need to be dipped in ink, allowing for smoother, simpler writing. <br>
Interestingly, the first prototypes date far back to the 10th century CE tests in Arab Egypt, to create a pen that would not stain hands or clothes. A later prototype was also probably invented and created by Leonardo da Vinci. It was not until the 19th century that working prototypes started to be patented and manufactured in large numbers. The first English patent was issued to Frederick Fölsh, but many others were issued in the first half of the century. In the mid-20th century, fountain pens started to lose their prevalence as the preferred writing tool. <br>
In fountain pens, the ink is drawn from the reservoir (the internal storage) to the nib through a feed, a channel connected to the nib itself, regulating the amount of air and ink that can flow in the reservoir. Feeds are also fundamental to prevent the ink from leaking while the pen is put to rest.

In the mid-20th century, as ballpoint pens started to be more widely used, fountain pens lost their prevalence as the preferred writing tool. <br>
In fountain pens the ink, stored inside the pen, would be controlled and directed by the feed, a narrow channel close to the nib. Air pressure would help keep the flow constant and avoid spillage. The nib would be made of steel or gold, often tipped with a stronger material to increase durability.

            <p class="advanced short">Fountain pens became popular in the 19th-20th centuries, replacing the quills as the preferred writing instrument. Constant technical improvements refined their usage, further preventing spilling and making them more durable. </p>
            <p class="advanced medium">In the 19th-20th centuries, quills and dip pens (pens made of a metal nib applied to a handle) were rapidly replaced by fountain pens: capable of storing ink internally, fountain pens could speed and simplify the writing process. Although first attempts at creating pens with internal storage date back to the 1st century CE, it was only in the 19th century that the first fully working prototypes were patented and that fountain pens started to be produced in large quantities. <br>
Fountain pens relied on capillary action and gravity, and had to use specific, low-viscosity and water-based inks. 
</p>
            <p class="advanced long">Early fountain pens appeared back in the 10th century, but it wasn’t until the 19th century when they became more reliable and less prone to ink spillage or leaking. In 1809, one of the earliest prototypes was patented by Frederick Fölsch; in the course of the century many other patents were issued, and many technological improvements were applied to the feed (the narrow channel controlling the ink flow). In the 20th century, fountain pens became widely used for business, education and correspondence, while still being refined: different filling systems were developed, nibs became standardized, and high-quality materials were employed to improve durability. By the mid-19th century, fountain pens started getting replaced by ballpoint pens, more convenient and less messy. <br>
In fountain pens, the ink is stored in the internal reservoir; the feed, which controls the ink flow, sits under the nib. The feed was made of plastic or ebonite, and contained fins that store excess ink, regulate flow and prevent ink blobs; the feed uses capillary channels to deliver ink steadily and allows air to travel back into the reservoir. The reservoir could take different shapes and forms, depending on how it was filled and on how the ink was stored: the cartridge, for example, was pre-filled and disposable, but offered a limited range of inks; the converter had a reusable piston mechanism and allowed for bottled ink; the piston fillers draw ink directly into the pen, using a built-in mechanism; differently, the vacuum filler used pressure difference; lastly, the eyedropper could hold a barrel filled entirely with ink. <br>
Fountain pens rely on capillary action and gravity: capillary action pulls the ink toward the nib, while gravity assists the ink flow. Surface tension prevents the ink from flooding the paper, while air pressure equalization keeps the ink moving smoothly. <br>
As traditional inks tended to be corrosive and prone to build-ups, fountain pens had to use low- viscosity and water-based inks: dye-based inks were vibrant and bright, but less permanent than pigment inks and iron-gall inks. The nibs required constant cleaning, to avoid ink build-ups that could affect their functioning.

                <p class="short"> The Sholes and Glidden typewriter, invented in 1874, is a machine used for typing that dates back over 150 years.
Before its advent, all text had to be written by hand, stroke by stroke, a slow and laborious process.
It was one of the earliest typewriters widely purchased and used, much like today's keyboard, helping people record text more efficiently.
</p>
                <p class="medium">The Sholes and Glidden typewriter was officially launched in 1874.
It emerged during the early stages of industrialized office work and was one of the first typewriters to achieve commercial success.
</p>
                <p class="long">The introduction of the Sholes-Glidden typewriter in 1874 occupies a precise and pivotal historical coordinate in the evolution of writing instruments.
It emerged during the early phase of industrialization reshaping societal organization, when office documentation was rapidly expanding alongside corporate growth. Handwriting could no longer meet the era's new demands for speed and standardization in text production.
</p>
            </div>

            <div class="intermediate">
             <p class="intermediate short"> The Sholes and Glidden typewriter emerged in the latter half of the 19th century, an era when factories and companies began proliferating rapidly. In 1874, the Remington company brought it to market as the Remington No. 1. At that time, more and more people needed to write documents and record information, but handwriting alone was slow and messy, unable to keep up. The typewriter arrived just in time, like a timely helper, making written communication fast and standardized for the first time. From then on, the way offices wrote would never be the same.</p>
            <p class="intermediate medium">The Sholes and Glidden typewriter emerged against the backdrop of industrialization in the latter half of the 19th century. In 1874, Remington introduced it to the market as the Remington No.1.
This era witnessed rapid growth in commercial activities, fueling increasing demand for standardized, reproducible written texts.
The typewriter's emergence coincided with a historical inflection point where handwritten documents could no longer meet office efficiency demands.
Thus, it became a pivotal temporal marker in the transition from handwriting to mechanized text production.
</p>
            <p class="intermediate long">The Sholes-Gridden typewriter entered the market in 1874 under the name Remington No. 1, its timing aligning precisely with the accelerated industrialization of the late 19th century.
At that time, the expansion of commercial activities created a structural demand for standardized, reproducible text. The inherent limitations of handwritten documents in terms of speed and consistency had become a significant bottleneck constraining office efficiency.
The typewriter's emergence precisely coincided with this historical inflection point. It was not only a technological response to practical demands but also marked a clear temporal watershed in the evolutionary lineage of writing instruments: before it, textual production relied on individual manual labor; after it, writing embarked upon a new era of mechanization and standardization.
 </p>
            </div>

            <div class="advanced">
            <p class="advanced short">From a historical perspective, the Sholes-Gridden typewriter emerged in the mid-to-late 19th century, an era of rapid global transformation.
As factories proliferated, railroads crisscrossed the landscape, and governments and corporations expanded, the volume of documents requiring documentation surged.
Yet prior to 1874, every word had to be painstakingly written by hand—a process that was not only slow but also produced inconsistent handwriting across individuals.
It was precisely at this juncture that the Sholes-Gridden typewriter emerged, becoming the first truly widely adopted typewriting machine.
Its emergence was no accident. It was born just because the times demanded it.
From that point onward, the way offices conducted their writing underwent a fundamental transformation: shifting from handwriting to machine typing.
</p>
            <p class="advanced medium">From a temporal perspective, the Sholes and Glidden typewriter appeared during the critical historical phase of the mid-to-late 19th century.
As the Industrial Revolution advanced, commercial institutions, railway systems, and government departments placed unprecedented demands on the volume and standardization of written documents.
Prior to 1874, text production relied primarily on manual writing, a method increasingly revealing limitations in speed and consistency.
It was against this backdrop that the Sholes and Glidden typewriter entered the market, becoming the first commercially successful mechanical typing device.
Its emergence was no accident, but a direct response to industrial society's new demands for written production.
Chronologically, this typewriter marked the formal turning point in office writing—shifting from manual labor to machine-assisted production.
</p>
            <p class="advanced long">From a temporal perspective, the emergence of the Sholes-Gridden typewriter precisely aligned with the historical juncture in the mid-to-late 19th century when industrial society demanded a structural overhaul of writing production methods.
The deepening Industrial Revolution spurred the expansion of commercial institutions, railway systems, and government departments, leading to a sharp increase in the volume and standardization requirements for document production. Handwriting, as the dominant method, became increasingly inadequate in terms of speed and consistency.
The 1874 market entry of the typewriter was not an isolated technological event, but rather the inevitable product of the convergence between industrial society's writing demands and mechanized production capabilities at a specific historical moment.
Within the evolutionary sequence of writing instruments, it marked a structurally significant turning point in time. Office writing thus completed its paradigm shift from manual labor to mechanically assisted production, laying the historical foundation for the continuous evolution of word processing technology thereafter.

                <p class="long">The IBM 6580 Displaywriter officially launched in 1980. At that time, most offices still relied on typewriters for writing documents. Computers were still a distant dream for ordinary people, used only by large companies and research institutions.
Before its advent, the office writing process was as follows: first, the document was typed out; if an error was found, it was either covered up with correction fluid or the entire page was retyped. This process was time-consuming and laborious, but everyone was used to it because there was no better option.
The Displaywriter emerged in this context. It wasn't a general-purpose computer, but a machine specifically designed for writing documents. You could see your own handwriting on the screen, correct mistakes, and then print it out—much more convenient than a typewriter.
Its timing was quite special, appearing a full year before the IBM PC. Those one or two years represented a fascinating historical gap: typewriters were no longer sufficient, personal computers were not yet widespread, and dedicated word processors briefly became the most advanced office writing tools.
The Displaywriter stood at the very center of this historical gap, one of the most important writing tools of that brief transitional era, witnessing the first step in the shift from purely mechanical to digital office writing.

            <p class="intermediate long">The IBM 6580 Displaywriter was released in 1980, a year earlier than the IBM PC. Its timeline falls within the historical transition period between dedicated word processors and general-purpose personal computers, before a clear winner had emerged. It is one of the most representative writing tools of that particular stage.
In that era, the writing needs in offices clearly exceeded the capabilities of typewriters. Numerous documents required repeated revisions, something typewriters could hardly handle. The market urgently needed a new writing tool, but general-purpose personal computers were not yet mature and were still very expensive. The Displaywriter appeared precisely in this historical gap, filling the transitional zone between typewriters and personal computers with a machine specifically designed for word processing.
It represents a development path in the evolution of digital writing tools that once seemed promising but was ultimately superseded by general-purpose personal computers. The logic of dedicated word processors was to perfect one task, while the logic of general-purpose computers was to solve all problems with one machine. History ultimately chose the latter.
On the timeline of writing tools, the year 1980, where the Displaywriter was positioned, marks the true starting point of the transition from the mechanical age to the screen age in digital office writing, even though it ultimately failed to reach the end.

            <p class="advanced short">The IBM 6580 Displaywriter, released in 1980, occupies a rather unique position on the historical timeline of writing tools: it appeared during a historical window before dedicated word processors were replaced by general-purpose personal computers, representing a development path in the evolution of digital writing tools that ultimately failed to become mainstream.</p>
            <p class="advanced medium">The IBM 6580 Displaywriter, released in 1980, occupies a rather unique position on the timeline of writing tools. It emerged during a window of opportunity when the historical competition between dedicated word processors and general-purpose personal computers was still unresolved.
A full year before the IBM PC, the Displaywriter's arrival coincided with a crucial juncture in the transition from mechanical typing to screen-based digital text processing in office writing. At that time, two distinct paths to digital writing existed in the market: one was the dedicated word processor, represented by the Displaywriter, focused on perfecting one task; the other was the later-emerging general-purpose personal computer, attempting to solve all problems with a single machine.
History ultimately chose the latter, which gives Displaywriter a unique historical significance as it is one of the most important nodes on a path in the evolution of digital writing tools that ultimately failed to become mainstream.
</p>
            <p class="advanced long">The debut of the IBM 6580 Displaywriter in 1980 occupies a rather intriguing position on the historical timeline of writing tools. It predates the IBM PC by a full year, appearing during a crucial window of opportunity when the historical competition between dedicated word processors and general-purpose personal computers was still unresolved.
From a historical perspective, 1980 was a time when office writing tools faced profound structural pressure. The limitations of the typewriter as the dominant writing tool had been fully exposed, and the contradiction between the high friction costs of document modification and the ever-increasing demand for office documents became increasingly prominent. The market demand for more efficient writing tools had reached a critical point. However, the software ecosystem of general-purpose personal computers was not yet mature, failing to provide a sufficiently reliable solution for general office writing. It was during this historical gap that specialized word processors, represented by the Displaywriter, briefly became the primary medium for digital office writing.
The product logic represented by the Displaywriter deserves in-depth examination. It adopted a specialized design path, focusing all its functions on the single task of word processing, thereby achieving higher reliability and a lower barrier to entry. This logic was perfectly reasonable at the time, but it also foreshadowed the competitive difficulties it would inevitably face after the rise of general-purpose personal computers.
In the evolutionary sequence of writing tools, the Displaywriter's position thus holds dual historical significance. On the one hand, it was a truly early practitioner in the process of digitizing office writing, bringing screen editing and document storage into the mainstream office environment, completing a significant paradigm shift in the history of writing tools. On the other hand, its rapid decline clearly illustrates the evolutionary logic of the writing tool market: when a general-purpose machine can perform the work of a specialized machine at a lower cost, the specialized path becomes difficult to sustain. The year 1980 is therefore both the highlight of dedicated word processors and the historical starting point for their demise.

The IBM PC 5150 was officially launched in 1981, when personal computers were still a foreign concept to most people.
It gave ordinary people their first opportunity to use computers at home or in the office to write text and process documents, marking a significant starting point for digital writing tools to enter the lives of ordinary people.
</p>
                <p class="medium">The IBM PC 5150 was developed by the American giant IBM, with a key figure behind it: Don Estledge, who led a small team to complete the computer's development. They made a very bold decision at the time: instead of locking all the technology into IBM's own hands, they allowed other companies to develop the accompanying software and hardware. This decision sounds simple, but its impact was far-reaching, as it directly led to the emergence of a large number of word processing software programs, truly turning this computer into a tool that ordinary people could use to write. It was precisely because of Don Estledge's crucial decision that the IBM PC transformed from an ordinary computer into a historic product that changed the way humans write.</p>
                <p class="long">The IBM PC 5150 was developed by the American giant IBM, with a key figure behind it: Don Estledge. He led a small team of only a dozen people to complete this history-changing computer in a very short time. At that time, IBM was one of the world's most trusted technology companies, known as the "Big Blue." It was precisely because of IBM's name that many companies and ordinary people who were initially hesitant about computers were willing to believe that this machine was a reliable and worthwhile writing and office tool. Estledge's team made a very bold decision at the time: not to lock all the technology into IBM's own hands, but to allow other companies to develop the supporting software and hardware. This decision changed everything. Soon, word processing software specifically developed for the IBM PC began to emerge in large numbers, allowing ordinary people to easily write articles, letters, and reports on computers for the first time. Before they made this decision, word processing software on computers was very rare, and writing on a computer was still a complex and difficult task for most people. After this decision, writing gradually shifted from typewriters to computer screens, turning a new page in the history of writing tools. So when we ask, "Who invented the IBM PC 5150?", the answer isn't just the name Don Estledge, but the open decision he and his team made. It was this decision that transformed a computer into a historic tool that changed the way humans write. </p>

            <p class="intermediate long">Released in 1981, the IBM PC 5150 marked a pivotal moment in the transformation of personal computers from niche hobby tools to mainstream office equipment. Before its arrival, the personal computer market, while existing, was highly fragmented, with incompatibility between different brands, a severely limited software ecosystem, and digital writing as a practice that had never truly transcended professional technical circles. IBM's entry fundamentally changed this landscape. As one of the world's most commercially credible technology companies at the time, IBM's brand endorsement dispelled the doubts of businesses and individual users about personal computers, quickly transforming potential market demand into real need. Simultaneously, its open technical architecture spurred the rapid expansion of the compatible PC industry and software ecosystem, leading to a surge in word processing software. For the first time, keyboard-driven digital writing gained the software foundation necessary for widespread adoption. Therefore, the significance of 1981 in the history of writing tools goes beyond just the release of a product; it marks the true starting point of the historical process of digital word processing's full penetration from professional tools into mainstream writing practices. Before the IBM PC 5150, typewriters remained the dominant tool for office writing; after it, personal computers gradually replaced typewriters, becoming the primary writing medium at the end of the 20th century. The speed of this historical shift itself confirms the precision of the IBM PC 5150's timing: it fell precisely within a historical window of opportunity when societal demand for standardized digital writing tools had matured but a suitable medium had not yet been found, thus completing a far-reaching era transition in the history of writing tools.

</p>
            <p class="advanced medium">The release of the IBM PC 5150 in 1981 marked a profoundly structurally significant point in the historical evolution of writing tools. Its arrival coincided with a crucial window of opportunity in the standardization process of the personal computer industry. The commercial credibility brought by IBM, coupled with the expansion of the software ecosystem fostered by its open architecture, constituted the dual driving force behind the transformation of digital writing tools into social infrastructure.
Prior to this, the personal computer market was fragmented, lacking a unified software ecosystem, and digital word processing as a writing practice had not yet formed a large-scale social foundation. The release of the IBM PC 5150 and the subsequent rapid emergence of word processing software fundamentally changed this landscape, enabling keyboard-driven digital writing to gain widespread acceptance across professional boundaries for the first time.
From a long-term perspective of the evolution of writing tools, 1981 marks the true starting point of the historical process of the full-scale migration of human writing practice to digitalization, the historical significance of which has been continuously validated in the decades that followed with the continued popularization of personal computers.
</p>
            <p class="advanced long">The release of the IBM PC 5150 in 1981 occupies a profoundly structurally significant position in the historical evolution of writing tools. It marks the true starting point of the process by which keyboard-driven digital word processing fully penetrated from the professional fringe to mainstream social writing practice, its significance extending far beyond the event of a single product launch.
From a historical perspective, the personal computer market before 1981 exhibited typical characteristics of early technology diffusion: multiple incompatible platforms coexisted, the software ecosystem was highly fragmented, and potential users remained hesitant due to the lack of unified standards. While digital writing as a practice was technically feasible, it failed to break through the market boundaries of early adopters due to the aforementioned structural obstacles, resulting in a significant gap between it and mainstream writing practice.
The arrival of the IBM PC 5150 bridged this gap through two mutually reinforcing mechanisms. First, IBM, as the world's most commercially credible technology company at the time, fundamentally reduced the perceived risk for businesses and individual users adopting digital writing tools, transforming substantial potential demand into real market action. Secondly, the rapid expansion of the compatible computer industry and third-party software ecosystem spurred by open technology architecture enabled word processing software supply to reach the critical mass required to support widespread handwriting adoption within a short period. This provided unprecedented functional support for keyboard-based digital writing.
In the macro-sequence of the evolution of writing tools, 1981 marks a social tipping point in the transition of human writing media from mechanical to digital. Before the IBM PC 5150, typewriters remained the dominant tool for office writing, with digital word processing confined to the practice of a small number of professional users. After its release, personal computers rapidly replaced typewriters, gradually establishing their historical position as the primary writing medium from the late 20th to the early 21st century.
This speed of transformation itself confirms the historical precision of the IBM PC 5150's emergence: it fell within a historical window of opportunity where the collective demand for standardized digital writing tools had accumulated sufficiently, yet a suitable medium had not yet been found, thus becoming a temporal coordinate for a profound paradigm shift in the history of writing tools.

                <p class="short"> In the early 1980s, most computers were big and bulky, made up of three separate parts: a main box, a screen, and a keyboard. You had to type commands to get them to do anything. The Apple Lisa, introduced in 1983, was the world's first computer sold to the public that let you point and click on pictures using a mouse, instead of typing.
</p>
                <p class="medium">Long ago, computers were huge and expensive, beyond the reach of ordinary people. Back then, computers didn't have the icons and mice we see today, just rows and rows of text instead. You had to type specific commands on the keyboard for the computer to understand what you wanted it to do. It was like you had to use a special secret language to talk to the computer. In 1983, Apple introduced a computer called the Lisa. For the first time, it allowed people to operate a computer by clicking icons on the screen with a mouse. It was like pointing at things with your finger. You don’t need to memorize complex commands. This was a huge leap forward for writing. People could finally write on computers in a more natural way. Though few bought the Lisa back then because it was so expensive, it showed us what computers would become in the future: a writing tool accessible to everyone.</p>
                <p class="long">The Apple Lisa was a remarkable computer released in 1983, marking a remarkable turning point in computing history. Before the Lisa's debut in the 1970s and 1980s, computers remained unfamiliar devices, accessible only to large corporations and scientists. Computers back then were bulky and expensive, resembling massive mechanical monsters that dominated half a wall in offices. You need to type commands line by line using a keyboard for the computer to understand you, like speaking in code. While some labs were experimenting with more intuitive interfaces, these technologies remained only toys for scientists, completely inaccessible to the ordinary people. Under this background, the Lisa came with a revolutionary new way to interact: clicking icons on the screen with a mouse, as natural as pointing with your finger. However, computer hardware at the time was very powerful, and storage costs were very high. Very few could afford a Lisa. In this way, it arrived too soon, like a visitor from the future knocking on the right door at the wrong time. However, it served as a bridge, connecting the old era of command-line computing to the new age of icon-and-mouse interaction. The story of the Lisa teaches us that sometimes the importance of an invention lies not in its commercial success, but in pointing the way forward.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="intermediate">
             <p class="intermediate short"> The Apple Lisa was officially released in January 1983, at a time when most users were still using command lines and DOS systems. Yet Apple Lisa adopted the graphical user interface (GUI) and mouse in that era, allowing users to interact with computers by clicking icons and dragging windows for the first time, rather than memorizing complex commands.</p>
            <p class="intermediate medium">In the evolution of writing tools, the Apple Lisa released in 1983 marked a remarkable turning point. Before its arrival, personal computers still relied on text-based DOS systems, requiring users to interact with machines by typing commands. This meant that computers, as writing tools, demanded a complex learning process. Graphical user interfaces existed only in research institutions at that time, not yet part of everyday life. The Lisa first brought this technology to the commercial market, allowing ordinary people to perform operations through clicking and dragging. It liberated “writing” from the command languages, making the tool transparent and intuitive. Born at the historical juncture when computers transitioned from specialized fields to everyday applications, Lisa's timing was both its strength and limitation. Its steep $9,995 price tag and the immature market environment ultimately led to its commercial failure. Yet it foresaw the mainstream adoption of GUIs years ahead of its time. In the long history of writing tools, Lisa stands as one of the most significant pioneers of its era.</p>
            <p class="intermediate long">The Apple Lisa computer, officially released in 1983, marked a truly significant turning point in the history of personal computers. Before its advent, in the 1970s and 80s, computers were specialized tools reserved for large corporations and research institutions, with ordinary people having virtually no access to them. Computers of that era were bulky, expensive, and extremely unfriendly; users had to input lines of abstract text commands via keyboard for the computer to execute tasks. The whole process felt more like speaking a foreign language to a machine. While research institutions like Xerox were exploring more intuitive graphical interfaces in laboratories, these technologies never truly left the lab. The Lisa changed everything. It was the first personal computer to bring a graphical user interface and mouse to the commercial market, allowing ordinary people to operate a computer by clicking icons on the screen, rather than memorizing commands. However, the Lisa’s high price of $9,995 and its immature software ecosystem led to commercial failure. But its historical significance far exceeds its sales figures. It predates the Macintosh by a full year and Windows by nearly three years, pointing the way for the future of personal computers before others had even grasped the direction. Lisa's story illustrates that a product's commercial failure and historical value are not always the same thing. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="advanced">
            <p class="advanced short">Apple Lisa launched in January 1983 was as a remarkable milestone. Born in an era when DOS command lines dominated desktop, it introduced graphical interaction concepts into the consumer market. This occurred one year before the Macintosh and nearly three years ahead of Windows 1.0. Before it, humans adapted to the language of machines. After it, machines began to adapt to human intention.
</p>
            <p class="advanced medium">If we place the evolution of human writing tools on a historical timeline, Apple's Lisa from 1983 stands precisely at a remarkable turning point. Before it, computers as writing mediums relied heavily on text commands, requiring users to operate a machine language to navigate the tool. This mirrors the historical logic where writing was dominated by few elites before the spread of printing. The tools themselves formed barriers to entry into the realm of writing. Drawing heavily on Xerox PARC's research in graphical interaction, Apple Lisa realised the desktop metaphor-based graphical user interface on a commercial personal computer. By replacing abstract syntax with visual symbols, it fundamentally restructured the relationship between humans and writing tools. This transformation holds significance in the history of writing comparable to previous leaps from quill to fountain pen, or from typewriter to word processor. Lisa's commercial failure illustrates the common difficulties during technological shifts. Tools ahead of their time often struggle to find a matching social context in their era. Yet viewed through the lens of long-term historical development, it initiated a profound shift in writing tools from subjecting human intuition to machine logic to aligning with human intuition. One year ahead of the Macintosh and nearly three years before Windows on the timeline, the Lisa was destined to be a prophet rather than a harvester. Its historical significance far exceeds its commercial value, making it an indispensable case study in the democratization of writing tools.</p>
            <p class="advanced long">Released in 1983, the Apple Lisa marked a clear dividing line in the history of personal computers, though few could see it at the time. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the personal computer market existed, but it still heavily relied on text-based command interfaces. Ordinary users had to master an abstract command language to operate the machines, a barrier that fundamentally limited the possibility of computers becoming a mass-market tool. Meanwhile, the concept of a graphical user interface (GUI) wasn't original to Lisa; Xerox PARC had completed its core research in the 1970s, but it remained in the laboratory stage and never achieved commercialization. What Lisa did was bring these still-academic concepts to the consumer market for the first time, turning icons, windows, and mice from research prototypes into real commercial products. Its failure was not without reason: its $9,995 price tag, limited software ecosystem, and the structural contradiction between hardware cost and performance at the time all contributed to its inability to win over the market at that historical juncture. But the reasons for its failure also illustrate one thing: Lisa wasn't a flawed product, but rather a correct judgment made at the wrong time. It predates the Macintosh by a year and Windows by nearly three years, outlining the fundamental direction of personal computer evolution for the next decade when neither the technology nor the market environment was yet mature. To understand the Lisa, one cannot simply look at how many units it sold, but rather at what it proved possible at that historical moment.

                <p class="short"> The Apple Cadillac PDA was a new type of handheld device that emerged in the early 1990s, an era when computers were becoming increasingly smaller and more personalized.
It was designed to allow people to carry digital information with them, making it a very advanced writing and recording tool for its time.
</p>
                <p class="medium">The Apple Cadillac PDA debuted in the early 1990s, before smartphones existed, when small devices called "personal digital assistants" (PDAs) were beginning to gain popularity.
These devices allowed people to carry personal information such as contacts, schedules, and notes in their pockets for the first time. While PDAs gradually faded into history after the advent of smartphones, early designs like the Cadillac laid the foundation for the mobile computing we take for granted today.
</p>
                <p class="long">The Apple Cadillac PDA belonged to the first personal digital assistant (PDA) devices to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These small, handheld computers allowed people, for the first time, to manage calendars, address books, notes, and various lists on the go, without the need for a bulky laptop.
In that era, companies like Apple and Palm were racing to develop such devices, each exploring simple input methods and portable computing capabilities. It was a highly experimental period—no one was entirely sure what these devices should look like or what they should do.
Later devices added more and more features, including wireless communication and media playback, but the generation represented by the Cadillac PDA established the core concept of "putting personal information in your pocket."
It wasn't until the advent of smartphones that all these functions were integrated into a single device, and the PDA gradually faded from the scene. However, in the history of writing and note-taking tools, it represented a significant step from pen and paper to digitalization.

            <div class="advanced">
            <p class="advanced short">The Apple Cadillac PDA emerged in the early 1990s, coinciding with the historical transition of personal computing devices from desktop to handheld form.
As the prototype of the Newton system, it foreshadowed the historical direction of the evolution of writing and information recording tools towards digitalization and handheld operation, serving as an early material testament to this paradigm shift.
</p>
            <p class="advanced medium">Released in the early 1990s, the Apple Cadillac PDA fell within a historical window of opportunity before smartphones dominated mobile computing and before the rise of personal digital assistants (PDAs).
Its PDA form factor marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of writing and information recording tools, signifying the transition from paper-based records to digital, handheld management. Although the PDA form factor was eventually superseded by smartphones, early designs like the Cadillac profoundly influenced the fundamental paradigm of mobile computing and serve as an indispensable historical marker for understanding the evolution of today's digital writing tools.
</p>
            <p class="advanced long">The historical coordinates of the Apple Cadillac PDA lie in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a timeframe itself possessing profound structural significance. It emerged during a historical window when the form factor of personal computing devices was still undefined and mobile digital information management was still in the exploratory stage as a practice.
As a device form, the PDA was the first to separate personal information processing functions such as calendars, address books, notes, and lists from desktop computers, compressing them into a portable handheld device. It marked a crucial juncture in the evolution of writing and recording tools, transitioning from paper-based personal organizational systems to portable digital management. The competition among companies like Apple and Palm in this field was essentially a collective exploration of the fundamental question: "What should a mobile digital writing and recording tool take?"
The historical moment of the Cadillac PDA was precisely the most open stage of this exploration, input methods, interaction logic, and functional boundaries were all being experimentally defined, without a dominant paradigm yet to emerge. While subsequent devices gradually integrated wireless communication and media functions, the core concept established by this early design, replacing paper-based personal recording systems with portable digital tools, formed the conceptual foundation for all subsequent mobile computing devices.
Smartphones eventually integrated these functions into a single device category, bringing the PDA form to an end. However, from a long-term perspective of the history of writing tools, the historical point in time for the Cadillac PDA marks the starting point of a profound transformation in digital writing and recording practices, from desktop to mobile and from professional to personal.

                <p class="long">The U.S. Robotics Palm Pilot 5000 officially launched in 1996. At that time, smartphones didn't exist, most people still relied on paper notebooks for note-taking, and computers were still bulky desktop devices, inaccessible by hand.
Before its arrival, there were similar handheld devices, such as Apple's Newton and Cadillac PDAs, but those devices were too expensive and cumbersome to use, making them inaccessible to the average person. Even more problematic was the immaturity of handwriting recognition technology at the time; devices often failed to recognize handwriting, leading to frustrating experiences.
The Palm Pilot was different. It was more reasonably priced, had a simpler design, and offered more accurate handwriting recognition, making it the first time many ordinary people were willing to use a digital device for note-taking, contact management, and schedule management. It did these things well enough that people genuinely wanted to carry it with them every day.
Its release in 1996 was a significant milestone in the history of writing instruments. Before that, digital writing tools were toys for a select few tech enthusiasts; after that, recording and writing with digital devices gradually became a daily habit for many.
The emergence of Palm Pilot is like a door being opened. It shows people that one day everyone will use digital tools to write and record, and that day is not far away.

            <p class="intermediate long">The U.S. Robotics Palm Pilot 5000 entered the market in 1996, a time clearly significant in the history of digital writing tools. It coincided with a turning point in the evolution of personal digital assistant devices from niche experiments to widespread adoption.
Prior to it, devices like the Apple Newton and Cadillac PDA had validated the basic concept of handheld digital writing, proving the feasibility of handwriting on a screen with an electronic pen. However, these early devices faced two fundamental obstacles: high prices and immature handwriting recognition technology, resulting in a user experience far below expectations. This kept digital handwriting tools confined to a small circle of early adopters, preventing them from truly entering the daily lives of ordinary users.
The Palm Pilot addressed both of these issues. Its lower price reduced the barrier to entry, while the Graffiti handwriting recognition system, specifically designed for handheld devices, significantly improved recognition accuracy by simplifying letter strokes, making handwriting input truly reliable for the first time.
Its timing also aligned with the rapidly growing demand for mobile information management among business professionals in the mid-1990s. More and more people need to manage contacts, schedules, and notes outside the office, and Palm Pilot provides a perfectly usable solution for this.
In the timeline of writing tool evolution, 1996 thus becomes a clear watershed: digital handwriting recording tools were, for the first time, truly ready to enter the daily writing practice of the general public, laying the foundation for the full arrival of the mobile digital writing era thereafter.

</p>
            <p class="advanced long">The U.S. Robotics Palm Pilot 5000, launched in 1996, occupies a profoundly significant position in the historical evolution of digital writing tools. It marked a crucial turning point in the evolution of handheld digital writing devices, transitioning from proof-of-concept to widespread adoption, and signifying the beginning of handwriting input's acceptance as a mainstream digital writing paradigm.
From a historical perspective, the Palm Pilot's emergence was not an isolated technological event, but rather built upon a series of earlier explorations. The Apple Cadillac PDA and Newton MessagePad had already prototyped handwriting input, demonstrating the technical feasibility of this interaction paradigm, but failed to penetrate the early adopter market due to insufficient handwriting recognition accuracy and high price barriers. This legacy issue constituted the fundamental obstacle to the widespread adoption of digital handwriting tools before 1996, and it was precisely the core problem that the Palm Pilot needed to solve.
Palm Pilot filled this structural gap through breakthroughs in two dimensions: First, the Graffiti handwriting recognition system, designed specifically for handheld input scenarios, significantly improved recognition reliability through a simplified stroke strategy, reducing the friction costs of handwriting input to an acceptable threshold for users; second, a more competitive pricing strategy expanded the potential user base of this writing tool from early adopters of technology to ordinary business users, completing the market transition of digital handwriting tools from niche to mainstream.
In a broader socio-historical context, the significance of 1996 is equally undeniable. At that time, the informatization of global business activities was accelerating, the demand for mobile office work was rising sharply, and the digital transformation of writing and recording behaviors had sufficient social momentum. The emergence of Palm Pilot perfectly matched the structural needs of this historical window of opportunity.
Therefore, from the long-term perspective of the evolution of writing tools, the 1996 timeline of the Palm Pilot 5000 marks not only the birth of a successful commercial product, but also the true starting point of a profound historical transformation in human writing practice from paper records to mobile digitalization. Before it, digital handwriting was an unfulfilled promise; after it, this promise began to become a daily reality for more and more people.
