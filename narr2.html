                            <p class="short"> Sumerians, one of the earliest civilizations in human history, were probably the first to use clay tablets as a writing support.  They invented cuneiform, one of the earliest writing systems in human history, and with clay tablets they kept written records of their economical activities and of their culture, politics and religion. Clay tablets were also used by other Mesopotamian civilizations and later became the chosen vehicle for diplomatic correspondence in Mesopotamia and in the Near East, even for those people, like Egyptians, who typically preferred other supports.  </p>
                            <p class="medium"> Sumerians were one of the earliest civilizations in human history, known for their incredible advances in science, technology, agriculture and culture. As a matter of fact, they invented cuneiform, one of the earliest writing systems in human history, to keep records of their business activities. But a writing system alone was not sufficient: they also needed a writing support. Although it can’t be said how and by whom clay tablets were invented, the Sumerians were surely among the first to use them, and in particular to use them to write texts and documents. Plenty of other civilizations in Mesopotamia- the region where Sumerians were locate-, also used clay tablets, usually to keep texts written in cuneiform; even those cultures who typically preferred other supports, like Egyptians, used clay tablets, especially when for diplomatic correspondence with rulers in Mesopotamia and in the Near East. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="long"> As for many innovations that happened far in the past, it’s not possible to tell who was the first person to use clay to create clay tablets. What is known, however, is that the Sumerians were among the first people to use clay tablets for writing: ever since the 4th millennium BCE, Sumerians used to clay to leave written traces of different types as a support for their economical, religious and political activities.<br>
The Sumerians were one of the earliest civilizations in human history: they lived in Mesopotamia, “the land between two rivers”, where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers provided abundant water, making it possible for people to farm and settle in one place. Early settlements evolved into cities: around 3500 BCE, the Sumerians began forming cities, creating one of the first known urban societies. Sumerian society was organized in city-states, each with its own ruler. Religion played a major role in daily life: Sumerians had a polytheistic faith, meaning they believed in multiple, different gods, and believed the gods could influence natural events like floods and droughts. As the center of their cities usually stood a ziggurat, a large temple for priests to perform rituals to the gods. <br>
Sumerians are known for their many achievements in different areas, such as mathematics, architecture and engineering, but their greatest achievement is the invention of writing: cuneiform, one of the earliest writing systems in human history, was invented by Sumerians around 3500-3000 BCE, originally to keep records of business and economical activities, but soon adopted in every contexts of daily life. Cuneiform found its best writing support in clay tablets: it’s thanks to this combination that historians can reconstruct life in ancient civilizations, and that we nowadays can still read on the oldest known epic stories of the world: the Epic of Gilgamesh. <br>
From then on, clay tablets carved with cuneiform texts were adopted by other civilizations, both Mesopotamian, like the Akkadians, the Babylonians and Assyrians, or more distant, like Hittites and Mycenaean Greeks. The Egyptians, on the other hand, strongly preferred papyrus; however, they did use clay tablets, especially during periods on contact with Mesopotamian people or for diplomatic correspondence. This is also why the Amarna Letters, the series of tablets to which this exemplar belongs to, is extremely fascinating: not only they testify to the use of clay tablets in ancient civilizations, but they also remind us of their extreme importance for diplomatic relations among foreign rulers. <br>

                            <p class="intermediate short"> Clay was one of the earliest writing supports, widely exploited by ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia and in the Near East. Among them, Sumerians were surely the first to use them extensively as a writing support: clay tablets were regularly used to write texts in cuneiform, the writing system that Sumerian invented in the 4th millennium BCE and one of the earliest in human history. </p>
                            <p class="intermediate medium"> Clay is one of the earliest and most commonly used writing materials. Cheap and easily accessible, it was molded in the desired shape- usually, as a rectangle- and its surface, while wet, would be inscribed with a stylus, usually in bone or metal. The inscribed tablet would then be either left to dry in the sun or baked in specific ovens, becoming durable. The oldest clay tablets we know date back to the IV millennium BCE.  <br>
As one of the earliest writing supports, it’s not easy to pinpoint exactly when they were first used or by whom. However, Sumerians were probably the first to use them extensively: clay tablets were regularly used to write texts in cuneiform, the writing system that Sumerian invented in the 4th millennium BCE and one of the earliest in human history. Clay tablets carved with cuneiform texts were adopted by other civilizations, like the Akkadians, the Babylonians and Assyrians, and were widely for diplomatic correspondence. <br>
An example of the latter use is tablet E29794, belonging to the Amarna Letters, a series of Egyptian tablets found in 1888 in el-Amarna (modern name of Akhenaten), and dating back to the 14th century BCE. It reports the letter written from Tushratta, king of Mitanni (an area nowadays corresponding to northern Syria and Turkey), to Tiy (or Teye), Great Royal Wife of pharaoh Amenhotep III and mother of Akhenaten: the king hopes for stronger ties between the kingdoms.

Tablet E29794 is a clay tablet belonging to the so-called Amarna Letters, a series of Egyptian clay tablets discovered in 1888 in el-Amarna, modern name of Akhetaten, the capital city funded by the Pharaoh Akhenaten (or Amenhotep IV) and abandoned after his death. The tablets contain rich information on the political and diplomatic relationships of the territory in the 14th century. Of great importance are the exemplars that testify to the rebellions and uprising in different parts of the kingdom. Tablet E29794 preserves the letter written from Tushratta, king of Mitanni (an area nowadays corresponding to northern Syria and Turkey), to the Tiy (or Teye), queen of Egypt and mother of Akhenaten: the letter recalls the friendship between the royal houses of the kingdoms and wishes to strengthen it. <br>

The Sumerians, inventors of cuneiform, were among the first to use them extensively to preserve any kind of written document, be it a business record or a religious text. Resistant and durable due to clay’s properties, clay tablets are susceptible to extreme temperatures and high humidity. Tablet E29794 is a clay tablet belonging to the Amarna Letters.

                             <p class="advanced medium"> Clay was one of the earliest and most popular writing support. It’s not possible to determine exactly their first invention, but typically they are associated with Mesopotamian and Near East civilizations and, in particular, with Sumerians, probably the first to use them extensively as writing support. <br>
Their appreciation and pervasive use of clay tablets is strictly connected to economical and cultural reasons: as their business and trade increased, keeping records of the transactions and of the stored goods became fundamental. The need for better recordkeeping led to the development, in the 4th millennium BCE, of cuneiform, one of the earliest writing systems: soon, clay tablets were used to store any kind of document, from business records to religious and literacy texts. <br>
As they were durable and relatively cheap, clay tablets were extremely popular and used in many different contexts. Clay’s physical properties made clay tablets resistant to degradation and the attacks of fungi and bacteria; its composition can be analyzed to determine the tablets’ original geographical locations. <br>
Clay tablets were readily adopted as the prevalent writing support in Mesopotamia and in the Near East, but they were also widely accepted as the preferred medium for diplomatic correspondence: an example is tablet E29794, a clay tablet belonging to the Amarna Letters, a series of tablets discovered in 1888 in el-Amarna (Akhetaten). The tablets contain letters from the kings and governors of Western Asia to the pharaohs Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV. Tablet E29794 preserves the letter written from Tushratta, king of Mitanni, to the Tiy (or Teye), queen of Egypt, Great Royal Wife of pharaoh Amenhotep III and mother of Akhenaten: the letter recalls the friendship between the royal houses of the kingdoms and wishes to strengthen it.

                            <p class="advanced long"> Clay was one of the first writing support in human history. Although it’s not possible to determine who or when first invented them, it’s fair to say that Sumerians were among the first to use them to keep written records of their activities. <br>
Sumerians, one of the earliest human civilizations and one of the first urban society, are renowned for their many achievements, in plenty of different fields: to counteract the damaging effects of the Tigris and Euphrates’ floodings, they developed an irrigation system to protect and improve their agriculture; to honor their patron gods, in each city they built impressive ziggurats; they created calendars based on the moon, a base-60 number system which influenced modern timekeeping and overall improved  transportation, trade and farming efficiency. <br>
Above all, they invented cuneiform, one of the earliest writing systems, and used clay tablets to write and keep texts and documents of any kind. Cuneiform and clay tablets are how the Epic of Gilgamesh was preserved through the centuries, and how historians can study and reconstruct ancient civilizations in the Near East. <br>
Clay was an extremely popular and efficient writing support: its physical properties made tablets particularly resistant and durable. Unlike organic materials, such as papyrus, parchment or wood, clay is not susceptible to rot or biodegradation and is mostly not interested by the attack of insects and fungi. Under stable, favorable burial conditions, clay tablets thus can be preserved with little damage; extreme temperatures and high humidity, however, can affect them greatly. Clay’s composition can also be analyzed to determine the origin of tablets and the geographical source: the chemical composition of clay varies depending on its local environment and on the concentration of its mineral content. <br>
Clay tablets were readily adopted by other civilizations in Mesopotamia, in the Near East and, more rarely, in the Mediterranean. The Egyptians, who usually preferred papyrus, used clay tablets as well, albeit seldomly: clay tablets were the optimal choice for diplomatic correspondence with rulers in Mesopotamia or in the Near East. <br>
Of this type are the clay tablets belonging to the Amarna Letters, a series of tablets discovered in 1888 in el-Amarna (Akhetaten), the capital city funded by Pharaoh Akhenaten (or Amenhotep IV, c.1350-1334 BCE) and abandoned after his death. The tablets contain letters from the kings and governors of Western Asia to the pharaohs Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV: as such, they contain rich information on the political and diplomatic relationships of the territory in the 14th century. Plenty of the letters are from Hittites, Babylonians, Mitanni, and Canaanite cities; of great importance are the exemplars that testify to the rebellions and uprising in different parts of the kingdom. The texts are mostly written with cuneiform script, rather than in Egyptian hieroglyphs, attesting to the widespread use of cuneiform, especially for diplomatic relations, and in Akkadian, the preferred diplomatic language in the ancient Near East. Tablet E29794 preserves the letter written from Tushratta, king of Mitanni, to the Tiy (or Teye), queen of Egypt, Great Royal Wife of pharaoh Amenhotep III and mother of Akhenaten: the letter recalls the friendship between the royal houses of the kingdoms and wishes to strengthen it.

                                <p class="short"> Papyrus was one of the most common writing supports in ancient times. Typically associated with Egyptians, it was obtained from the stem of the papyrus plant, found mostly in Egypt and in the Mediterranean regions. </p>
                                <p class="medium">Papyrus was an extremely common writing support in ancient times, probably used from the 3rd millennium BCE. It was relatively cheap to make, as it was obtained from the plant with the same name found in Egypt and Mediterranean areas. Papyrus is typically associated with the Egyptians: although there is no trace that clearly explains exactly how or when papyrus was invented, we know that the papyrus plant was extremely common in the Nile Delta, and that Egyptians used papyrus as a writing material as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, since the First Dynasty  (circa 3100–2900 BCE). </p>
                                <p class="long">In ancient times, papyrus was used as writing support probably since the 3rd millennium BCE. As for many other ancient writing materials, it’s not possible to say for sure when it was invented and by whom, but traditionally it’s strongly associated with Egyptians, who have been using it as a writing support ever since the First Dynasty (circa 3100–2900 BCE). <br>
The ancient Egyptians were one of the world’s most remarkable early civilizations, living along the Nile River in northeastern Africa from around 3100 BCE to 30 BCE, when Egypt became part of the Roman Empire. The Nile River provided plenty of water and fertile soil, allowing the Egyptians to grow wheat, barley and vegetables. Egyptian society was highly organized and hierarchical: the pharaoh, considered a god-king, ruled over the entire country; below him were priests, nobles, scribes, artisans, farmers and laborers. Religion was then extremely important: Egyptians were polytheistic, worshipping gods such as Ra (the sun god), Osiris (god of the afterlife), Isis, and Anubis. They believed strongly in the afterlife, which led to elaborate burial practices, including mummification, and built incredible tombs, temples, and monuments- such as the pyramids of Giza- to honor pharaohs and gods and display their power. <br>
The Egyptians developed another of the earliest writing systems, called hieroglyphics, which combined pictures and symbols to represent sounds, ideas, and objects. Writing was essential for keeping records, religious texts, laws, and literature. Scribes wrote on walls, statues, pottery and, most importantly, on papyrus.

Papyrus sheets were produced by organizing the strips obtained from the inner pith of the plant. </p>
                                <p class="intermediate medium">Extremely popular, papyrus was the principal writing support in ancient Egypt and in the Mediterranean areas, where the plant it was obtained from was easily available. Egyptians in particular are regarded as the first to use papyrus and as its biggest producers; although it’s not possible to say when exactly they invented it, it’s known from archeological finds that they used papyrus as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, during the First Dynasty. <br>
The papyrus sheets were obtained by processing the pith of the plant: the strips were organized perpendicularly and in multiple layers, which would be then pressed together to create a single sheet. The obtain “page” was then dried and polished. Papyrus sheets would then usually be bound together to form scrolls. As clay tablets, papyrus was used for almost any document: from legal and religious texts to business transactions and records, papyrus sheets could contain any type of text, making them an extremely important source of information for understanding the everyday life and historical contingencies of their writers. <br>
Around the 4th century CE, in Europe it was substituted by parchment, which was more durable, although more expensive and difficult to make.

Egyptians are regarded as the first to use papyrus and as its biggest producers; although it’s not possible to say when exactly they invented it, it’s known from archeological finds that they used papyrus as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, during the First Dynasty. Egyptians were great inventors and innovators: they made important contributions in science, mathematics and technology; thanks to their engineering competences, they built massive stone monuments, canals, and irrigation systems. They also developed medical practices, using herbs and surgical techniques to treat injuries and illnesses. <br>
The papyrus sheets were produced by cutting the plant’s internal pith and arranging the resulting strips in perpendicular layers. The layers would be pressed one on top of the other, creating a singular, thicker sheet; once dried, the resulting sheet would be polished to increase the smoothness of the surface. Multiples sheets would be tied to create long scrolls, easy to carry around and to store. Papyrus was not used exclusively as a writing device: its fibers could also be used to make, among the many, baskets, mats, ropes and sandals. <br>
Writing was typically done with ink and reed pens. Papyri were cheap and easy to make, but poorly resistant to humidity: by the 4th century, in Europe they were substituted by parchment, a material obtained from animals’ skin, which was more difficult to create and expensive, but more resistant. <br>
Papyrus is more rigid than other supports and does not fold easily; additionally, it suffered from high humidity levels and temperate climates. Because of all these conditions, it is better preserved in arid environments, protected from any kind of mechanical stress.

Papyrus sheets are obtained from the processing of the internal pith of the Cyperus papyrus L., an aquatic sedge native to the Nile Delta and found in other areas of the Mediterranean. The interior would be cut into strips, which would be then arranged perpendicularly to strengthen the resulting sheet. Multiple papyrus sheets would usually be bound together into volumina: the text would be written in columns perpendicular to the scroll’s length. 
Egyptians used papyrus as a writing support as early as the First Dynasty, and built a florid commerce based on the exportation of scrolls and sheets: an extremely popular product in the Mediterranean markets, Egyptians would exchange it for goods like olive oil, silver, wine and wood.

Although it was commonly used by many civilizations, Egyptians were, surely, its greater users and producers: the production of papyrus sheets was extremely important in ancient Egypt and became a standardized craft as early as the 3rd millennium BCE. 
Egyptians used papyrus as a writing support as early as the First Dynasty, as the earliest surviving papyrus fragments can attest, but even before that, papyrus was used for the creation of different types of objects, like boats, mats, ropes. To make papyrus, the plants would be deprived of the outer rind and the internal pith sliced into thin strips (usually 1-2 cm wide). The strips would be arranged perpendicularly: a first layer would be laid horizontally on a flat surface, with the strips organized one next to the other; the second layer would be placed on top on the first one, but vertically, creating a cross-laminated scheme. The layers would then be dampened with water: this step was crucial to activating the sugars, primarily polysaccharides, that made the strips adhere to one another. The obtained sheet would then be pressed and dried, then smoothed with stones or shells and, usually, tied with other sheets into scrolls. 
Rolled scrolls and sheets constituted one of ancient Egypt’s most valuable exports: Egyptians exported papyrus products throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, and especially to the Greeks and the Romans, who needed them for books, legal documents and government records. Crucial cultural centers like Athens, Rome and Alexandria depended considerably on Egyptian papyrus. 
Papyrus was transported by river boats along the Nile, then by the sea through the Mediterranean trade routes. It was then typically exchanged for goods that Egypt lacked, like wood, silver, copper, wine and olive oil. The exportation was often state-controlled: pharaohs and officials controlled papyrus’ production and trade and would sometimes restrict its exportation to protect Egypt’s political interests. Around the 3rd-4th century CE, however, as parchment became steadily preferred as the principal writing material, papyrus dominance as the main writing support started to decline; however, its production, exportation and use kept on for many centuries, up to the 12th century.

                             <p class="short"> Paper, probably the most important and known writing support, was revolutionized and refined by Cai Lun, an imperial officer in the 1st century CE China. His papermaking process made paper cheap and efficient, and helped make it as affordable and popular as it is known today. </p>
                             <p class="medium">For centuries, before computers, smartphones and Internet, almost every piece of knowledge and every communication was done with paper. Paper was invented in China, probably around the 2nd century BCE, but is traditionally connected to Cai Lun, the imperial officer that revolutionized its production process in the 1st century CE. Cai Lun (c. 50-121 CE), who served at court during the Han Dynasty, innovated and refined the papermaking process, making paper more affordable and easier to produce efficiently and in large quantities. Paper was quickly adopted to redact any type of document and art and then spread across countries to become the most popular and used writing support. </p>
                             <p class="long">Before computers, smartphones and Internet, everything was made with paper: every document, every information, every piece of knowledge and communication was almost always written on paper. The importance of this medium cannot be overstated. 
Paper itself has a long history, probably even longer than what we believe right now: the earliest surviving fragments date back to the 2nd century BCE, but we still can’t know for sure if it wasn’t invented even earlier than that. What we know, however, is that paper was invented in China, and that in 1st century CE an imperial officer, Cai Lun, revolutionized paper and papermaking to the extent that his name was then and is still now inexorably connected to the invention of paper. 
Cai Lun (c. 50-121 CE) served during the Eastern Han Dynasty under Emperor He; he was responsible for overseeing the production of weapons and tools, which probably gave him access to technical and technological knowledge and to different materials. Around 105 CE, he formally presented his improved method for papermaking: by using everyday materials like mulberry bark, hemp fibers, rags and old fishing nets, he made paper cheaper, easier to produce, and definitely more affordable and manageable than silk and bamboo, the materials back then typically used to write. The impact of its innovation was incalculable: paper quickly became essential for government administration, education, literature, art. Centuries later, this paper and papermaking technique would spread along trade routes to the Islamic world and to Europe, transforming and reshaping culture and communication.
During his lifetime, Cai Lun was honored with a high status at court, but, unfortunately, it didn’t last long, as later political struggles caused his downfall and death, in 121 CE. His legacy, however, endured, and he is still remembered as a key figure in the history of technology and communication.

                            <p class="intermediate short"> Paper is an extremely important and versatile medium, for centuries the preferred choice for writing. As one of China’s Four Great Inventions, paper is still highly regarded, and so is its main innovator, Cai Lun (c.50-121), an imperial officer during the Han Dynasty, whose life was deeply intertwined with political intrigues.  </p>
                            <p class="intermediate medium">For centuries the principal instrument for communication, literacy and record-keeping, paper is an incredibly valuable material, and its inventor is still now highly regarded. Although recent findings prove that paper was invented as early as the 2nd century BCE, or even earlier, traditionally the most important figure in its evolution is Cai Lun (c.50-121), the imperial eunuch that in 105 CE refined its production and made it affordable and practical. 
As an imperial eunuch, Cai Lun’s life and career were deeply intertwined with political struggles, leading him to his death in 121 CE.  
</p>
                            <p class="intermediate long">Traditionally, the origin of paper is traced back to ancient China around 105 CE, attributed to Cai Lun (c. 50-121 CE), an imperial eunuch serving under Emperor He during the Han Dynasty; nowadays, recent findings led to believe that paper was invented and used as early as the 2nd century BCE, but Cai Lun is still regarded as a fundamental and pivotal figure for paper innovation and diffusion. 
Before Cai Lun, paper was usually made from hemp fibers and was typically rough and fragile. As writing supports, bamboo and silk were preferred, but they came with some shortcomings: bamboo scrolls were heavy and difficult to store, while silk was extremely expensive. In 105 CE, Cai Lun thus introduced his new papermaking process: by combining multiple materials, most importantly trees’ bark, he made paper more robust, cheaper and easier to produce. As he standardized its production, as well, paper became smoother, thinner, more affordable, and essential. Such was the impact of Cai Lun’s innovation that in Chinese culture he is remembered in ancestor worship and in folklore. 
His inventiveness was probably nourished and strengthened while he served as Director of the Imperial workshops, overseeing the manufacture of weapons, tools and court supplies: this position gave him technical knowledge and access to materials and skills, ideal conditions for experimentations. During his career at court, he was appreciated for his honesty, craftmanship and literary knowledge; for his innovations in papermaking, he was promoted and rewarded. But as Emperor He died and court politics shifted, Cai Lu became involved in political struggles connected to his early years at court and in 121 CE, under Emperor An, he committed suicide.

                            <p class="advanced medium">Cai Lun (c. 50–121 CE) was long honored as the inventor of paper, and he is celebrated for greatly improving papermaking techniques and enabling its widespread use. Born into a poor family during the Eastern Han dynasty, he rose through the imperial court as a eunuch and official, eventually becoming Director of the Imperial Workshops, a role that gave him technical expertise and access to materials. In 105 CE, he formally presented an improved type of paper made from rags, hemp fibers, and mulberry bark, which was cheaper, stronger, and easier to produce than earlier forms. His invention earned him high honors, but could not avoid him a tragic death in 121 CE.</p>
                            <p class="advanced long">For centuries, before archeological findings provided new insights, Cai Lun (c. 50-121 CE) was remembered and honored as the inventor of paper.

Not much is known about Cai Lun’s early life: he was born in the Guiyang Commandery, in the Hunan province, during the Easter Han dynasty (25-220 CE), into a poor family. His exact date of birth is unknown and traditionally estimated around 50 CE. More is known about his career at the imperial court, as an imperial eunuch and officer: although it’s not clear the exact date of his employment, it’s probable that he started working at court in the 70s; around 80 CE he was promoted to a Xiao Huagmen, becoming responsible for the messages between the imperial apartments and the outside court. In the same years, he was involved in the political machinations at court, and in particular with the aspirations of Empress Dou. Ever since 88 CE, he served under Emperor He; in the same year, he was nominated Shangfang Ling, Director of the Imperial Workshops, overseeing the manufacture of weapons, tools and court supplies: this position gave him technical knowledge and access to materials and skills. It was probably also thanks to this experience that his invention started to take shape, and then came to realization: in 105, he officially presented his innovated paper, made of a mix of rags, hemp fibers and mulberry bark, more affordable and easier to produce. For his invention, Cai Lun was promoted and awarded, and was highly regarded and honored. His fate, however, took a turn for the worse, when Emperor An came to power, in 121 CE. His wife, Empress Yan Ji, intended to question and punish Cai Lun for his earlier involvement in the palace intrigues: to avoid a dishonorable death, Cai Lun committed suicide in the same year. 
A life deeply intertwined with political struggles and court intrigues, Cai Lun is to this day regarded as a crucial, highly influential individual, being remembered in Chinese culture both in ancestor worship and in folklore. His innovation made paper cheaper and more robust: before him, paper was mostly made of hemp fibers, appearing fragile and impractical. Thanks to him, higher quality, more resistant paper was produced, with lower costs and easier production process: his paper and papermaking techniques would travel across trade routes and become the blueprint for modern paper and paper production process.

Gutenberg (c. 1400-1468) was a German inventor, goldsmith and craftsman who, in the mid-15th century, invented and perfectioned the movable type print.

                             <p class="medium"> A pivotal figure in human history, J. Gutenberg (c. 1400-1468) has influenced how culture and communication were distributed for centuries, and even today, in the digital era, he is remembered as a fundamental figure for information and knowledge diffusion. 
J. Gutenberg (c. 1400-1468) was a German inventor, goldsmith and craftsman, who is credited with multiple inventions and innovations that helped creating and improving the modern movable type print: his printing process was fast, cheap and efficient, ensuring the production of hundreds of beautiful, identical and affordable books’ copies, making books more accessible and encouraging the diffusion and availability of knowledge.
Among the many inventions, the hand-mold is one of the most important, as it helped creating hundreds of cheap copies of types- the metal blocks used to represent alphabetic letters- speeding up the printing process and cutting the costs.
</p>
                             <p class="long"> In European and Western history, there are few people that can be said to have revolutionized communication and culture quite like Johannes Gutenberg did. His inventiveness and foresight shaped how culture is produced and how knowledge is distributed, leading to a proper revolution of how books and readings were seen and appreciated. 
J. Gutenberg (c. 1400-1468) was a German inventor, goldsmith and craftsman who, in the mid-15th century, invented and perfectioned the movable type print. Before him, there weren’t really many choices for producing books: mostly, you either copied a book by hand, a process that was extremely long, difficult and expensive, or, in the 14th-15th century, you used woodcut to create block books, a slightly quicker method, as you could realize multiple prints of the page by reusing the same woodblock, but still complex, time-consuming and expensive. Gutenberg’s printing process, on the other hand, was faster, cheaper, and capable of producing almost identical hundreds of copies of the same books: there was, truly, little competition. 
The details of Gutenberg’s early printing process are not known: as not a lot is known about his life and work in general, it’s very possible that his early printing process was a bit different from the later, traditional, standardized one; nonetheless, his movable type print helped pave the way for later innovations and refinements. Traditionally, Gutenberg is credited with multiple different inventions, the most important of which is the hand mold, capable of creating cheap, large quantities of metal types. A metal type is a small block on whose end is carved an alphabet letter: when some ink is deposited on the carved letter, the type can be used to “print” that letter on a page. Making a type, however, was an extremely long, complex and delicate process: each type was carved by hand, a process requiring a lot of time, skill and precision. The hand mold revolutionized this process: instead of having to carve multiple types of the same letter by hand, one single type was sufficient, and was used to create a matrix, a soft metal bar in which the letter would be incised by hammering the type on its surface. This matrix was then placed into the hand-held mold, a small machine with an empty recess on the inside, where the liquid metal was put. The metal would cool immediately, creating a perfect copy of the original type: now multiple copies of the same types could be created easily and quickly, without the need to hand-carve hundreds of them!
On top of that, Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of a specific type of ink and of a type of press mechanism that was faster than printing by hand; to top this all, his taste and ambition to create the most perfect, harmonious books, influenced the book production, leading to the creation and distribution of beautiful, artistic and carefully designed books.
 Gutenberg’s inventions led to true revolution in information and literacy in Europe, without which the Renaissance and Protestant Reformation would have been extremely different. Even in the era of digitality and technology, he is still remembered as one of the most important figures in humanity’s cultural and communication history. </p>

                              <p class="intermediate medium"> The invention of movable type printing revolutionized culture and communication, leading to great changes also in economics, politics, science and literature. This new printing system simplified the books production process, making books more affordable and widely accessible, leading to a significant increase in literacy and demands for knowledge and texts. <br>
This invention is credited to Johannes Gutenberg, (c. 1400-1468), a German goldsmith, craftsman and inventor, whose life was spent between Mainz and Strasbourg. Little is known about his life and education: most of the information we have concerns his relationship with his financer and business partner Johann Fust, which turned sour in the later years of their lives. 
</p>
                              <p class="intermediate long"> The invention of the movable type print is often referred to as a pivotal moment for the evolution of culture and knowledge, with a significant impact also on the economic, scientific, religious and political spheres.  The new printing system, in fact, simplified and sped up the books production process, allowing for the mass production of cultural and literary objects: books became cheaper, widely accessible and easily reproducible in fixed versions, which encouraged the spread of knowledge and transformed reading into a personal, accessible and ordinary activity.  <br>
The invention and refinement of this printing method is credited to Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1400-1468), a German goldsmith, craftsman and inventor whose inventions marked the first steps for modern printing methods and books production. Not much of his life is known: he was born in Mainz, sometimes between the late 14th century and the early 15th century, son of a patrician and merchant. He probably attended university; in the 1430s, he moved to Strasbourg and became a goldsmith, but more detailed knowledge on his education is not known. It was in Strasburg that he developed his ideas on the movable type print and realized the first machines and the first books copies, also thanks to a significant loan from Johann Fust, a wealthy goldsmith. Their collaboration, however, turned sour after Gutenberg’s inventions became public, revealing their value: Fust won the subsequent court case, obtaining control over Gutenberg’s workshop and later becoming a successful printer. Gutenberg, nonetheless, probably created a new printing shop, and in 1465 was awarded a title and stipend for his inventions. <br>
Differently from xylography, movable type print consisted into the creation of individual metal casts for each letter of the alphabet, which would then be organized and arranged into the intended lines or pages. The same letters’ casts could then be reused and rearranged to create different pages and mistakes could be easily fixed by swapping single letters, without the need to create ex novo a specific cast for that specific line. The system, thus, was more efficient and less resource-consuming, and allowed for increased flexibility and scalability.

Gutenberg (c, 1400-1468), a German craftsman and goldsmith who, in the mid-15th century, combined new technologies and materials to create the modern movable type printing. In particular, he introduced the hand mold, with which it was possible to create large quantities of types at lower costs, and introduced a mechanical press, which allowed for a uniform, reproducible and faster printing process. 
The first book to be ever printed with this method was the Bible: Gutenberg printed 180 copies of it, each copy now regarded as a pivotal testimonial to a radical cultural change.

Movable type printing was already known in East Asia, thanks to the inventions and innovations of artist and engineer Bi Sheng (990-1051); however, the invention of the modern movable type printing system is traditionally credited to Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1400-1468), a German craftsman who used his knowledge and skills as a goldsmith to create and refine a printing process that could simplify book production.  <br>
Gutenberg’s life and education are, to this day, unclear: it’s known that he was born in Mainz, son of Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden, patrician and merchant, and his second wife, Else Wyrich, daughter of a shopkeeper. As the son of a patrician, Gutenberg probably received a high-quality education from a young age and attended university; however, as his mother was not of the same social status, he could not inherit his father’s position as a member of the mint’s companionship. In the 1430s he moved to Strasbourg, where he worked as a goldsmith and, in the 1440s, developed his movable printing press. To finance his inventions, he asked and obtained a consistent loan from Johann Fust, a fellow goldsmith; their relationship, however, quickly deteriorated, and in the 1450s Fust won control of Gutenberg’s workshop in a court case. A bankrupted Gutenberg left Strasbourg and probably opened a new printing shop; for his achievements, in 1465 he received a title and a stipend from the Archbishop von Nassau, but died soon after. To this day, his name is remembered among those who changed and shaped history, and he is regarded as one of the most important figures in human history.<br>
Gutenberg’s movable type combined several technologies into a single, reproducible system. He developed a durable alloy made of lead, tin and antimony, which had a low melting point and was durable enough to last through thousands of impressions; as for the typecasting device, he introduced the hand mold, which allowed to rapidly cast identical letters, leading to the creation of uniform types. Gutenberg also adopted a different kind of ink: as traditional water-based inks were unsuitable for metal casts, he opted for oil-based inks that interacted better with metal and transferred cleanly to paper. Lastly, for the printing press he took inspiration from existing screw presses, typically used in papermaking, which provided even, uniform and repeatable pressure and helped sped up production’s times. Gutenberg’s earliest typefaces tended to imitate manuscripts and, in particular, their scripts, mostly to provoke a sense of familiarity among readers. Pages were designed to resemble manuscripts: as such, they were organized into two columns, contained justified text and allowed for hand-painted initial letters and rubrication. 
The Gutenberg’s Bible is the first, and probably most famous, product of Gutenberg’s press: Gutenberg realized 180 copies, mostly in paper but also in vellum, all with consistent typography and combining printed text and hand illumination

                            <p class="short">  Quills were the prevalent writing tool during the Middle Ages. They are typically associated with the medieval scribes working in monasteries: the scribes were responsible for producing beautiful complete copies of important texts, which implied a long, complex process of hand-copying texts on parchment using quills and calami. </p>
                            <p class="medium"> When talking of past writing tools, the quill is probably one of the most recognizable and known instruments: a quill is often seen as a symbol of a great writer and easily evokes the image of old books written in candlelight. <br>
Quills were mostly during the Middle Ages, and were one of the fundamental tools, along with the ink stored in calami and parchment, of the medieval scribes. Scribes were professional copyists who reproduced books and texts and ensured their survival and diffusion. They were mostly monks working in monasteries, and their work was characterized by silence, regular hours and strict rules.
</p>
                            <p class="long"> Before the modern printing press, texts were only produced by hand, and books existed only because scribes patiently copied them by hand. Their labor was slow, complex, and error-prone: what they chose to copy, how they copied it, and even the errors they introduced determined how a text would be known and distributed.<br>
The professional figure of the scribe emerged with writing systems: it first appeared in Mesopotamia, but it was as common in other ancient cultures, like Egyptians, Persians, Indians, Chinese, Greco-Roman. In the western world, they became fundamental in the Middle Ages, where, with their work, they ensured the transmission of culture and the survival of ancient texts. Most medieval scribes were monks who worked in monastic scriptoria, dedicated writing rooms in monasteries. Scribal work was both practical and spiritual: copying sacred texts was considered an act of devotion, and writing itself became a form of prayer, with discipline and repetition reinforcing religious obedience. Their work was characterized by silence, regular hours, and strict rules. <br>
Medieval scribes realized manuscripts, hand-written books made of parchment or vellum and often richly decorated. To write on them, they could use reed pens or, more often, quills. Quills were the main writing tool in the Middle Ages, especially when writing on parchment: obtained from birds’ feathers, as reed pens they could not store ink internally, so they had to be frequently dipped in the calamus, the inkwell which held the liquid ink.

                            <p class="intermediate short">  Medieval scribes were essential to the survival and transmission of knowledge: before printing, all books were copied by hand, and scribes’ choices shaped which texts endured and in what form. Many classical works survive today only through medieval manuscripts. <br>
Most medieval scribes were monks working in monastic scriptoria; scribes often acted as editors and commentators, producing multiple versions of the same text. Writing was done mainly on parchment or vellum using quills dipped in ink, tools that remained standard until gradually replaced by metal pens.
</p>
                            <p class="intermediate medium"> Medieval scribes played a crucial role in the preservation and transmission of knowledge. Before the invention of the printing press, books existed only because scribes manually copied texts, and their choices determined which works survived and in what form. Many ancient literary and philosophical texts reached the modern era through medieval manuscript copies, making scribal labor fundamental to cultural preservation. <br>
Medieval scribes were most often monks working in monastic scriptoria. For them, copying texts—especially sacred and liturgical works—was both a practical task and a spiritual act, governed by discipline, silence, and humility. Scribes were not merely passive copyists: they frequently acted as editors and commentators, adding corrections and marginal notes. <br>
Scribes primarily wrote on parchment or vellum, costly materials that required careful, high-quality workmanship. Manuscripts were typically written in refined scripts and often richly decorated. The main writing tool was the quill, usually made from goose, swan, or crow feathers and used with liquid ink. Over time, quills were gradually replaced by metal dip pens and later fountain pens.
</p>
                            <p class="intermediate long"> Medieval scribes were the primary agents through which knowledge survived, traveled, and evolved in Europe between roughly the 5th and 15th centuries. Long before the printing press, books and their copies existed only because scribes patiently copied texts by hand: their labor was slow, exacting, and pivotal: the choice of what to copy and the way a book was copied determined which texts were going to be distributed and which not, and in which shape and form. Plenty of ancient literary and philosophical texts survived to modern day through medieval copies made by scribes: their work, hence, was fundamental. <br>
The professional role of the scribe emerged in Mesopotamia, and was equally common in many ancient civilizations: as writing and reading were not common skills, educated scribes were necessary to redact and copy any type of texts. In the Middle Ages, most scribes were monks, and thus worked within monastic scriptoria, dedicated writing rooms attached to monasteries. For monks, scribal labor was both practical and spiritual; not differently from different, earlier cultures, copying sacred texts or liturgical books was considered an act of devotion. Writing itself became a form of prayer, with discipline and repetition reinforcing religious obedience. Silence, regular hours, and strict rules governed their work, with an emphasis on humility rather than on authorship. Scribes were not, however, always passive copyists: many acted as editors, translators and commentators, adding marginal notes and corrections. As a result, many medieval texts were different from their original, and different within each other: multiple copies of the same book usually differed slightly in some ways, making it difficult for modern scholars to understand how the original text used to be like. By the later Middle Ages, scribes increasingly worked outside monasteries: professional urban scribes produced legal documents, letters, and books for universities and wealthy patrons. <br>
Scribes usually worked with parchment or vellum: as the material was extremely expensive, the final product had to be of the highest quality. Usually, the manuscripts were richly decorated and written with specific, refined scripts. Scribes worked mainly with quills, dipped in liquid ink: quills were obtained from birds’ flight feathers, shed during the moult. Goose’ feathers were the most common, as well as swans’ feathers and crows’ feathers, the latter being especially useful for fine, detailed work. The end of the quill was sharpened to create the nib; as it tended to wear down easily, penknives were used to resharpen it when necessary. Funnily, quills did not keep the feathers, as the movies and the common imaginary would tell: the feathers, called barbs, were almost completely stripped down, and partially kept for fashion reasons only in the later centuries. Quills were used with inkwells, as they could not hold internal ink reservoirs. As the metal dip pens, and, more importantly, the fountain pens were introduced, the quill was slowly abandoned.

                            <p class="advanced short"> Before the modern printing system, monastic scribes preserved ancient and medieval texts through careful hand-copying, also ensuring their diffusion, albeit sparse. Their labor was slow and highly regulated, requiring great precision and visual consistency: the obtained manuscripts, written on parchment using quills and ink, were highly valuable and prestigious, for the materials used, the quality of the decorations, and the texts contained. </p>
                            <p class="advanced medium"> Scribes emerged alongside writing systems and were highly valued in ancient societies where literacy was scarce. Beyond copying texts, they played important roles in administration and legal work. In the Middle Ages, scribes became essential to the survival of ancient and medieval texts. <br>
Most European medieval scribes were trained monks working in monastic scriptoria: their work required great precision and care, as manuscripts had to meet high standards of accuracy and visual quality, making book production extremely slow and expensive. Scribes wrote on parchment or vellum using quills, which became common from the 6th century onward. The flexibility of quills allowed for refined scripts such as Carolingian minuscule and Gothic script.
</p>
                            <p class="advanced long"> Scribes emerged with writing systems: for centuries, reading and writing were not universal knowledge, and well-educated scribes were hence highly valued figures in every ancient civilization. Scribes weren’t just copyists: their skills were sought after also in the public administration and for legal services. In the Middle Ages, scribes became pivotal figures, as their work as copyists ensured that ancient or medieval texts would survive in modern times, albeit often in slightly different forms than their original. <br>
European medieval scribes were mostly specifically trained monks, who worked in the monasteries’ scriptoria. They were mostly tasked to copy religious or classic works, in Latin, Greek or Hebrew, regardless of their knowledge of the languages. Their work was strictly organized: scribes worked from dawn to the evening bells, every day except for the rest day. The copying process was time-consuming and required attention and care, not only to ensure the correctness of the text, but also to guarantee a high-level of quality to the manuscript as a whole: lines had to be straight and even and letters had to be regular and proper to the chosen writing script. It is estimated that a scribe would then be able to fully copy only two books per year. <br>
The scribes’ writing tools were typically parchment or vellum, calami, and quills. Originally, reed pens were used, but since the 6th century, quills became the common choice. To create a proper, high-quality quill, the choice of feathers was crucial. Usually, large flying feathers, shed during the molt, were the preferred choice; the feather’s shaft (or rachis) had to be strong, but flexible. Once the feather was chosen, it had to be dried for a prolong period of time, usually for weeks: the drying process made them sturdier and firmer. The nib had then to be cut by hand, usually using a small knife, and at a precise angle; an additional cut was made down the center to control ink flow through capillary action. The width of the cut could affect whether the writing would tend to be thinner or bolder. <br>
The ink would be deposited inside, in the hollow rachis, and along the cuts: surface tension and gravity would control how it moves across the writing supports. To properly use it, writers had to be careful on how much pressure they applied: too much pressure could split the nib, while too little would obstacle the ink flow. The quills’ peculiarities allowed scribes to create smooth curves and lines of different depths, leading to the refining of famous writing styles, like Carolingian minuscule and Gothic Script.

                               <p class="short">  The fountain pen was the first writing tool that could store ink internally, saving time during writing and avoiding staining papers and hands with ink. The first prototypes date back to the 10th century CE, but it wasn’t until the 19th century when the first patents for fully working fountain pens were issued. Like many other inventions, the fountain pen was gradually improved over the years by different inventors and innovators. </p>
                               <p class="medium"> Differently from reed pens, quills and dip pens, the fountain pens didn’t have to be used with inkwells, as they could store the ink in an internal reservoir. Their sleek and useful design led to the mass-production in the 19th century: the first English patent was issued in 1809 to Frederick Fölsch, but the first to become successful was the 1819 patent of John Scheffer’s. Interestingly, experimental prototypes of similar pens dated back to 10th century CE in Arab Egypt and to the Renaissance drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci. </p>
                                <p class="long"> As we’ve seen, before the 19th century writing was a messy, slow process: the probability of staining pages, hands and clothes with ink was extremely high, and often proved right. This problem, however, was well-known for centuries: the first experiments for a pen that could prevent ink spillage date back to the 10th century CE, when a prototype that could be held upside down without risks was invented in the Fatimid caliphate. Leonardo Da Vinci, as well, is known to have worked on a potential prototype during the Renaissance! <br>
The first working prototypes, however, began to appear in the 19th century: in the beginning of the century, plenty of patents were issued in Europe – in England, France and in USA, in particular- to inventors who proposed different solutions to the same problem. The first English patent was issued in 1809 to Frederick Fölsch, but the first to become successful was the 1819 patent of John Scheffer’s. During the century, this continuous evolution led to the proper invention of the fountain pen, the first writing instrument that could hold ink in an internal reservoir. Differently from reed pens, quills and dip pens, fountain pens did not need to be frequently dipped in the inkwell, saving time during the writing process; the internal reservoir and mechanisms which connected it to the nib prevented ink spillage, even when the pen was put down or upside down.

                               <p class="intermediate short"> Fountain pens emerged from many inventors’ efforts to improve traditional writing tools. Although early experiments date back to antiquity, practical fountain pens were developed and patented in the 19th century, enabling reliable and continuous writing. They later lost their dominance with the rise of ballpoint pens but remain significant as milestones in the evolution of writing technology.</p>
                               <p class="intermediate medium"> Fountain pens evolved through centuries of inventors’ innovations and ideas, aimed at overcoming the limitations of traditional pens, particularly the lack of an internal ink supply and frequent ink spillage. Although early attempts to create self-inking pens date back to antiquity, fountain pens were first introduced and refined in the early 19th century, when patented designs made large-scale production possible. Their development sought to regulate ink flow through internal reservoirs and feed systems. By the mid-20th century, fountain pens were largely replaced by ballpoint pens as the preferred everyday writing tool.</p>
                               <p class="intermediate long"> As for many inventions, fountain pens have increasingly evolved throughout decades thanks to the innovations of many different craftsmen. Through the centuries, plenty of inventors have tried to create a functional writing tool that could solve the issues of the traditional pens: the lack of an internal storage of ink, which made it necessary to frequently dip the writing tool in external inkwells and calami, and the constant ink spillage, which stained clothes, hands and, more importantly, expensive writing supports. 
Fountain pens, the first pens to hold ink internally, were introduced in the early 19th century, and were further refined in the following years. The first prototypes, however, date far back, to the 10th century CE tests in Arab Egypt to create a pen that would not stain hands or clothes. A later prototype was also probably invented and created by Leonardo da Vinci. It was not until the 19th century that working prototypes started to be patented and manufactured in large numbers. The first English patent was issued to Frederick Fölsh, but many others were issued in the first half of the century. In the mid-20th century, as ballpoint pens started to be more widely used, fountain pens lost their prevalence as the preferred writing tool.
In fountain pens the ink, stored inside the pen, would be controlled and directed by the feed, a narrow channel close to the nib. Air pressure would help keep the flow constant and avoid spillage. The nib would be made of steel or gold, often tipped with a stronger material to increase durability.

                               <p class="advanced short"> The fountain pen developed through centuries of experimentation and different inventors’ ideas. While early prototypes appeared as early as the 10th century, reliable fountain pens emerged in the 19th  century, with key contributions by Lewis Edson Waterman, whose 1884 capillary feed system enabled practical, leak-resistant pens. Fountain pens became widespread in the early 20th century; today, they remain valued as objects of craftsmanship and tradition.</p>
                               <p class="advanced medium"> The history of the fountain pen developed through centuries of refinement and innovation, driven by the ideas of plenty different inventors. In the 19th century reliable models emerged and began to replace quills and other traditional writing tools. Early patents include Frederick Fölsch’s prototype (1809) and Petrache Poenaru’s design (1827). A breakthrough came in 1884, when Lewis Edson Waterman introduced a capillary feed system that regulated ink flow, producing the first widely successful fountain pen.
In the 20th  century, fountain pens became widely used in business, education, and correspondence, while continued refinements improved their materials and functioning. By the mid-20th century, however, the invention of the ballpoint pen by László Bíró in 1938 shifted writing practices, and fountain pens were largely displaced.
Fountain pens store ink in an internal reservoir and regulate its delivery through a feed positioned beneath the nib. Ink flow relies on capillary action, gravity, surface tension, and air-pressure equalization. Different filling systems reflect varied approaches to ink storage and delivery. Because of their mechanisms, fountain pens require low-viscosity, water-based inks and regular cleaning to ensure proper functioning.
</p>
                               <p class="advanced long"> As for many inventions, fountain pens’ history developed through years of refinement and innovations, propelled by different inventors’ ideas and applications.
Early fountain pens appeared back in the 10th century, but it wasn’t until the 19th century that they became more reliable and popular and were mass-produced to replace quills and other traditional writing tools. At the base for the inventions stood the idea of building a tool less prone to ink spillage or leaking, and that it could hold ink internally. In 1809, one of the earliest prototypes was patented by Frederick Fölsch; less than twenty years later, P. Poenaru patented in France his own prototype, which used a swan’s quill as an internal ink reservoir. These early prototypes, however, still tended to leaking; in 1884, American inventor L. E. Waterman introduced a capillary feed system to regulate ink flow and solve spillage, creating the first widely successful fountain pen. 
In the 20th century, fountain pens became widely used for business, education and correspondence, while still being refined: different filling systems were developed, nibs became standardized, and high-quality materials were employed to improve durability. Mass production expanded through the growth of specialized pen companies. By the mid-20th century, however, the invention of the ballpoint pen by László Bíró in 1938 led to a shift in writing practices, and fountain pens were gradually replaced as the preferred everyday tool, becoming instead associated with tradition, craftsmanship, and symbolic value.
In fountain pens, the ink is stored in the internal reservoir; the feed, which controls the ink flow, sits under the nib. The feed was made of plastic or ebonite, and contained fins that store excess ink, regulate flow and prevent ink blobs; the feed uses capillary channels to deliver ink steadily and allows air to travel back into the reservoir. The reservoir could take different shapes and forms, depending on how it was filled and on how the ink was stored: the cartridge, for example, was pre-filled and disposable, but offered a limited range of inks; the converter had a reusable piston mechanism and allowed for bottled ink; the piston fillers draw ink directly into the pen, using a built-in mechanism; differently, the vacuum filler used pressure difference; lastly, the eyedropper could hold a barrel filled entirely with ink.
Fountain pens rely on capillary action and gravity: capillary action pulls the ink toward the nib, while gravity assists the ink flow. Surface tension prevents the ink from flooding the paper, while air pressure equalization keeps the ink moving smoothly. 
As traditional inks tended to be corrosive and prone to build-ups, fountain pens had to use low- viscosity and water-based inks: dye-based inks were vibrant but less permanent than pigment inks and iron-gall inks were more permanent. The nibs required constant cleaning, to avoid ink build-ups could affect their functioning.

                                      <p class="long"> When it comes to who invented the Sholes-Gridden typewriter, it's not just the story of one or two individuals. It was developed through the collaborative research of three men: Christopher Sholes, Samuel Thoreau, and Charles Gridden. Sholes was responsible for designing the machine's structure and the layout of the keyboard. They conducted numerous experiments and made repeated improvements until they finally produced a decent prototype. Later, a large company named Remington took an interest in this invention. With factories and workers at their disposal, they could mass-produce and sell it to the public. Thus, the typewriter became the Remington No. 1, finding its way into offices and the lives of ordinary people. Therefore, this machine that revolutionized writing was not the work of a single genius, but the result of collaboration between inventors and a major manufacturer.

                               <p class="advanced medium">George Breckensridge (1850–1917), the core inventor of the Breckensridge No. 5, profoundly shaped the historical trajectory of this writing instrument through his dual roles as inventor and entrepreneur.
He completed patent registration in 1892, transforming the design concept of a lightweight full-keyboard typewriter into a commercially viable product. Building upon this foundation, he established his own typewriter company and a global sales network.
In the history of writing instrument adoption, Breikensdorp's significance lies in his dual role as both a technological innovator and a market catalyst, transforming his invention into a writing practice accessible to users worldwide.
</p>
                               <p class="advanced long">The narrative of the invention of the Breckensrider No. 5 is deeply embedded within the broader professional trajectory and familial knowledge background of its creator, George Canfield Breckensrider.
Raised in a family of shorthand inventors, he developed a keen eye for the efficiency and limitations of writing instruments from a young age. Confronted by the bulky, cumbersome typewriters dominating the market at the time, he set out to simplify their structure and enhance portability as his core design objectives, fundamentally redefining the form logic of mechanical writing tools.
The acquisition of a pivotal patent in 1892 formally established his design philosophy, which evolved through continuous refinement into the Model No. 5. Its successful debut at the 1893 World's Fair not only solidified the product's market positioning but also laid the groundwork for subsequent production facilities and the establishment of a global sales network.
Blikensdov's dual role in creative production and market promotion reveals the deep mechanisms of writing instrument innovation under industrial conditions: a tool that transforms writing practices is both the crystallization of inventive thinking and the practical outcome of the inventor's active engagement and sustained drive within commercial and industrial systems.

The Olivetti Lettera 22 was a typewriter introduced by the Italian company Olivetti in 1950.
Upon its release, it became one of the most popular portable typewriters of the 1950s and 1960s.
</p>
                                <p class="medium">The creation of the Lettera 22 was the result of a collaboration between two individuals. Industrial design master Marcello Nizzoli was responsible for making it look beautiful and feel comfortable to use, while engineer Giuseppe Bego ensured its internal mechanisms functioned flawlessly.
Together, one focused on aesthetics and the other on technology, they crafted this portable typewriter for Olivetti that was both visually appealing and highly functional.
</p>
                                <p class="long">The birth of the Olivetti Lettera 22 was the result of a collaborative effort between designers, engineers, and a visionary company. Without any one of these elements, the typewriter would not have taken its final form.
Designer Marcello Nizzoli had been working at Olivetti since 1938, accumulating years of experience. This long tenure gave him a profound understanding of what a good writing instrument should feel like—not just functional, but pleasing to the eye and comfortable to handle. The Lettera 22's form and tactile operation perfectly embodied his vision.
Yet beautiful design alone was insufficient; engineer Giuseppe Bego's work proved equally crucial. He transformed Nizzoli's sketches into functional mechanical structures, solving the practical challenge of “how to make this machine both lightweight and sturdy.” His ingenuity enabled portability and durability to coexist within a single device.
Olivetti itself was far more than a mere financial backer. It possessed mature industrial production capabilities and a global sales network. It was precisely this platform that allowed Nizzoli and Bego's creation to be mass-produced and sold worldwide.
So when we ask, “Who invented the Lettera 22?” the answer isn't a single name, but a collaborative system with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. This also demonstrates that a tool that truly revolutionizes writing was never conceived by one person sitting alone in a room.

                           <div class="intermediate">
                                <p class="intermediate short"> The design of the Olivetti Lettera 22 was spearheaded by Italian designer Marcello Nizzoli, with development assistance from engineer Giuseppe Beccio, and manufactured by Olivetti. </p>
                                <p class="intermediate medium">The creation of the Lettera 22 represents a collaborative achievement in industrial design and engineering within Olivetti. Industrial design master Marcello Nizzoli oversaw the exterior aesthetics and human-machine interaction design, while engineer Giuseppe Beccio was responsible for the structural and technical implementation.
Their partnership delivered this portable mechanical typewriter to Olivetti, combining practical functionality with aesthetic value.
</p>
                               <p class="intermediate long">The birth of the Olivetti Lettera 22 represents the profound fusion of industrial design and mechanical engineering. Its core design stems from Marcello Nizzoli's years of design practice at Olivetti. Having contributed to the company's product design since 1938, Nizzoli believed that a writing instrument's appearance and feel were as crucial as its functionality—the Lettera 22 stands as the clearest embodiment of this philosophy, uniting visual elegance with practicality within a portable machine.
Simultaneously, engineer Giuseppe Bego was tasked with transforming these designs into functional mechanical structures, achieving both portability and reliability within a single chassis. Without his work, Nizzoli's vision would have remained on paper—Bejano solved a genuine technical challenge: how to make a machine light enough to carry while maintaining the mechanical precision required for writing.
Olivetti itself possessed mature industrial production capabilities and a global market operation system, providing a critical platform for the Lettera 22's manufacturing and promotion. This enabled the transformation of design and technological achievements into commercial success. It was precisely the company's robust production infrastructure and international sales network that enabled the creations born in Nizzoli and Bego's studio to reach writers, journalists, and office workers worldwide.
In essence, the Lettera 22 was not the solitary achievement of any single inventor, but rather a collaborative product of clearly defined roles and synergistic cooperation among design vision, engineering execution, and organizational scale—a model that profoundly influenced the innovation and dissemination of writing instruments throughout the industrial era.

                           <div class="advanced">
                               <p class="advanced short">The Olivetti Lettera 22 was introduced by Italy's Olivetti in 1950. Its primary inventors were corporate entities rather than individual inventors, reflecting the underlying shift in writing instrument innovation during the industrial era from solitary inventors to collective research and development systems.</p>
                               <p class="advanced medium">The creation of the Lettera 22 exemplifies the deep collaborative logic between industrial design and engineering within Olivetti. Master designer Marcello Nizzoli led the aesthetic and human-computer interaction design, while engineer Giuseppe Bego oversaw structural and technical implementation. Their division of labor and cooperation integrated functionality and aesthetic value into a single writing instrument.
This collaborative model signifies a fundamental shift in the logic of writing instrument innovation during the industrial era: a successful writing tool must no longer merely function well, but also inspire people to want to use it. The synchronized integration of functionality and aesthetics has become an essential prerequisite for writing instruments to reach the masses.
</p>
                               <p class="advanced long">The structure of the Olivetti Lettera 22's invention offers a clear example for understanding the logic behind writing instrument innovation in the industrial age—it was not the product of individual genius, but rather a collective achievement born from the deep collaboration of design philosophy, engineering capabilities, and corporate organization.
From 1938 onward, Marcello Nizzoli remained deeply involved in Olivetti's product design. Over a decade of accumulated practice forged his design methodology, systematically integrating aesthetic judgment with functional requirements. In his view, the form of a writing instrument was not an added ornament but an integral part of the user experience—tactile feel, visual appeal, and operational logic must harmonize as one. The Lettera 22 represents the most mature embodiment of this philosophy within portable writing instruments.
Yet a gap always exists between design intent and physical reality—precisely where engineer Giuseppe Bego's work proved invaluable. He transformed Nizzoli's vision into reliable mechanical structures, achieving the optimal balance between weight, volume, and durability within the constraints of contemporary technology. This allowed portability to exist without sacrificing functional integrity. This mutual translation between design and engineering formed the technical foundation enabling Lettera 22's creation.
Olivetti's role as an organizational platform constituted the indispensable third dimension of this innovation chain. The company's mature industrial production system and global market operations transformed design and technological achievements into commercially scalable products, completing the final leap from laboratory to user's desk.
This three-tiered collaborative structure holds exemplary significance in the history of writing instruments: it clearly demonstrates that innovation in writing tools during the industrial era was fundamentally a systemic process driven by division of labor, integration, and mass production—not merely an extension of any single individual's talent.

                                <p class="short"> Behind Apple's Lisa computer lies a name you've surely heard: Steve Jobs.
When the Lisa project was just getting started, it was he who made the decision: this computer would be operated in a completely new way that everyone could understand.
He believed the future of computing shouldn't be a bunch of incomprehensible text commands, but as simple and intuitive as describing pictures.
</p>
                                <p class="medium">The Apple Lisa project was initially driven by Steve Jobs behind the scenes.
After visiting Xerox's research center, he witnessed a revolutionary new way of interacting instead of typing commands, users could click icons on the screen with a mouse, as naturally as pointing at words on paper with a finger.
He believed this was how computers should be: tools accessible to everyone for writing and creating, not machines mastered only by experts.
He brought this vision to the Lisa project, making the graphical interface and mouse its core design.
Though he was later removed from the project, the direction he set remained, shaping the Lisa's final form.
</p>
                                <p class="long">Behind Apple's Lisa computer stood a pivotal figure, Steve Jobs. Yet his contribution wasn't soldering circuits or writing code, it was defining “what this computer should look like.” When he visited Xerox's research center and first encountered a graphical interface controlled by mouse clicks, he instantly recognized: this was how future writing tools should function, requiring no memorized commands, as natural as writing on paper. He brought this vision to the Lisa project, insisting that the graphical interface and mouse remain central. He believed computers should “serve people,” not force people to adapt to machines. This was a remarkably bold idea at the time, when nearly all computers still relied on text-based commands. Later, Jobs was removed from the project due to conflicts with management. Yet the direction he had set was deeply ingrained in Lisa's design, impossible to erase. So while Lisa was built by an entire team of engineers, the revolutionary seed that transformed it into a groundbreaking tool for writing and creation was planted by Jobs.
 </p>
                           </div>

                           <div class="intermediate">
                                <p class="intermediate short"> The birth of the Apple Lisa is closely tied to Steve Jobs.
In the project's early stages, he supported the concept of a graphical user interface (GUI), viewing it as the core direction for the future of personal computers. For Jobs, this vision extended to how people would write and create. He believed that a screen where you could point, click, and arrange text visually would transform the computer into a truly human writing tool. By pushing GUI to the center of Lisa's design, Jobs reimagined the computer as the next chapter in the long history of writing instruments.
</p>
                                <p class="intermediate medium">The Apple Lisa project was spearheaded by Steve Jobs in its early stages.
Deeply influenced by Xerox PARC's research on graphical interfaces, he insisted computers should interact with users through intuitive visual means.
Under his leadership, graphical interfaces, the mouse, and user-experience-focused design principles were integrated into the Lisa project.
Although Jobs was later removed from the project, the direction he established in its early stages profoundly shaped the Lisa's overall design philosophy.
</p>
                               <p class="intermediate long">During the development of the Apple Lisa, Steve Jobs did not participate in the technical implementation as an engineer. Instead, he emerged as a passionate visionary and project advocate.
After encountering the graphical interface prototype at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, he immediately recognized the profound significance of this interaction method for the future of personal computing. He sought to integrate this concept into Apple's product strategy.
In the early stages of the Lisa project, Jobs insisted on making the graphical user interface and mouse core design elements, emphasizing that computers should “serve people” rather than forcing users to adapt to machines.
This user-experience-driven vision was uncommon in the personal computer industry at the time.
Although organizational and managerial conflicts ultimately led to Jobs' removal from the Lisa project, the design direction he established in its infancy became deeply embedded in the system's overarching vision.
Therefore, when discussing the inventors of the Apple Lisa, Steve Jobs should be regarded more as a guiding force: he did not complete all the technical details, but he shaped the product's fundamental form at the conceptual level.
 </p>
                           </div>

                           <div class="advanced">
                               <p class="advanced short">The relationship between Apple's Lisa and Steve Jobs was impressive in tech history: he was both the project's most crucial conceptual architect and the man ultimately ousted from it.
In the project's early stages, Jobs transformed Xerox PARC's research on graphical interaction into Apple's product philosophy, promoted the design principle that computers should serve human intuition.
His influence on Lisa thus lived not only in the code, but also in the product's foundational logic.
</p>
                               <p class="advanced medium">The early advancement of Apple's Lisa project was, to a significant extent, an extension of Steve Jobs' personal vision and product philosophy.
Deeply inspired by Xerox PARC's research on graphical interfaces, he arrived at a judgment that was quite radical for its time: the paradigm of computer interaction must shift from abstract symbolic commands to intuitive visual operations. The core significance of this transformation lay in redefining the computer from a specialized tool into a writing and creative medium for ordinary people.
During his leadership phase, the Lisa project systematically incorporated graphical interfaces, mouse-based operation, and user-experience-centric design logic. This fundamentally translated the principle that “writing tools should obey the user's intuition” into concrete product decisions.
Although Jobs was later removed from the project, the design direction he established became deeply ingrained in Lisa's overall architecture. This signifies that his influence on Lisa lay not in technical implementation, but in fundamentally redefining the form and boundaries of the computer as a writing tool.
</p>
                               <p class="advanced long">In the development narrative of Apple's Lisa, Steve Jobs' role reveals a profound proposition about the essence of innovation: What does “invention” truly mean in the birth of a tool that rewrites history?
Jobs never intervened in Lisa's technical implementation as an engineer, yet he fundamentally determined the machine's very form. When he encountered the graphical interface prototype at Xerox PARC, he achieved more than a technical epiphany that he redefined the history of writing tools. He envisioned the potential to transform computers from command-driven professional devices into visually intuitive mass-creation media, and he translated this insight into an unshakable product philosophy.
In the early stages of his leadership over the Lisa project, the graphical user interface and mouse interaction were established as core design principles. The underlying logic was not merely a technical preference, but a fundamental restructuring of the relationship between humans and writing tools: the tool should fade into the background, obeying the user's intuition, rather than forcing the writer to learn the machine's language. This concept was nearly heretical in the personal computer industry of the time, yet it aligned profoundly with the deep logic of human writing tool evolution—from quill to fountain pen, each iteration fundamentally reduced the cognitive friction of writing.
Though Jobs was eventually removed from the project due to management conflicts, the design DNA he imbued remained inseparable from Lisa's architecture. This outcome itself demonstrates: the true inventor isn't necessarily the one who completes the work, but the one who establishes “what this thing should be” at the conceptual level. Within the historical lineage of writing instruments, Jobs' significance to Lisa lies precisely here.

                                <p class="long">The birth of the IBM Selectric typewriter was the result of collaborative efforts between a team of engineers and a designer.
The technical aspects were primarily handled by IBM engineer Horace Beatty and his R&D team. Building upon traditional typewriters, they innovatively invented a rotating spherical print head. Inside this ball, a mechanical coding system selected letters; when a key was pressed, it rotated to the corresponding character position and struck the paper. This design completely eliminated the key jamming issues common in older typewriters while enabling rapid font switching, making typing both fast and smooth.
The aesthetic and user experience design fell to industrial designer Elliott Noice. He established a unified, modern product identity for IBM, with the Selectric serving as its most iconic embodiment. Its clean, elegant appearance and comfortable operation conveyed that this was more than just a machine—it was a fine tool worthy of a place on any desk.
This synergy of technology and design made the Selectric both functional and beautiful, ultimately securing its long-term dominance in the office equipment market.

                               <p class="advanced short">The IBM Selectric was developed internally at IBM under the leadership of American engineer Horace Beatty. Collective technical problem-solving replaced individual invention as the core mechanism driving the iteration of writing tools.</p>
                               <p class="advanced medium">The core technological innovation of the IBM Selectric originated from the team led by engineer Horace Beatty. Building upon existing electric typewriters, they developed a spherical printing element that fundamentally resolved the persistent key jamming issues inherent in traditional linkage mechanisms, significantly enhancing the machine's reliability and stability during high-volume document production.
Simultaneously, industrial designer Elliott Noice spearheaded the machine's aesthetic and industrial design, seamlessly integrating functionality with visual appeal within a single product. This dual-track collaboration of technology and design reaffirmed the inherent logic of writing instrument innovation in the industrial era: engineering breakthroughs determine what a tool can do, while design determines whether people will choose to use it.
</p>
                               <p class="advanced long">The development journey of the IBM Selectric typewriter stands as a quintessential example of mid-20th century design and engineering collaboration in electric office equipment. Its success was rooted in the deep integration of technological innovation and industrial design.
On the technical front, the R&D team led by IBM engineer Horace Beatty achieved the most crucial mechanical breakthrough for this writing instrument. They abandoned the traditional linkage-keybar mechanism used for decades in favor of a rotating spherical typeface unit. This mechanism enabled character selection through internal mechanical coding and linkage systems. It not only fundamentally eliminated the persistent key sticking issues inherent in traditional keybar systems but also granted the machine the ability to rapidly switch fonts, systematically pushing the functional boundaries of writing instruments forward.
On the design front, industrial designer Elliott Noice spearheaded the machine's aesthetics and human-computer interaction. He established a cohesive, modern industrial identity for IBM, with the Selectric serving as its most iconic physical embodiment. Noice's involvement endowed the machine with a distinct visual language beyond its functionality, elevating its market appeal to levels unattainable by purely functional products.
This interdisciplinary collaboration model reveals the underlying logic of writing instrument innovation in the industrial era: engineering breakthroughs define a tool's capability boundaries, while design determines whether these capabilities are genuinely embraced and sustained by users. The synergy between these two elements is the fundamental reason the Selectric maintained its long-term dominance in the office writing market.
